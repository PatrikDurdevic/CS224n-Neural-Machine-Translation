In January 2004 the volume was increased to Euros 25 billion .
On average in 2003 , LTROs amounted to 19 % of the total net liquidity provided through open market operations .
As in previous years , the dispersion of bids in LTROs was slightly higher than in MROs .
On average over the year , the weighted average rate exceeded the marginal rate by 1.7 basis points , compared with 1.9 basis points in 2002 .
The percentage of bids which were satisfied in each LTRO in 2003 ranged between 42 % and 60 %, averaging 51 %, compared with a range of 36 % to 72 %, averaging 50 %, in 2002 .
STANDING FACILITIES The two standing facilities offered by the Eurosystem , i.e. the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility , aim to provide and absorb overnight liquidity , signal the general stance of monetary policy and bound overnight market interest rates by setting an upper and a lower limit for those rates .
In 2003 the width of the interest rate corridor determined by the two standing facilities remained unchanged at 200 basis points , centred around the minimum bid rate of the MROs .
There are normally two reasons for credit institutions to have recourse to the standing facilities : -- Recourse to standing facilities may arise in the case of aggregate liquidity imbalances , i.e. if the banking system as a whole has either too little or too much liquidity relative to the aggregate reserve requirements .
Aggregate recourse normally takes place only towards the end of the maintenance period , when the banking system must settle its position against any accumulated aggregate liquidity imbalances via recourse to the standing facilities .
The bigger spikes in the recourse to standing facilities during 2003 shown in the lower panel of Chart 28 mostly reflect the offsetting of such aggregate imbalances .
-- Unexpected payment flows between individual banks at the end of the day , when the money market is no longer liquid , may trigger individual recourse to the standing facilities .
Individual recourse is normally spread fairly evenly across the maintenance period .
Individual recourse may become substantial on days when payment system components fail , such as on 3 July 2003 , when recourse to the marginal lending facility was Euros 7.7 billion .
In 2003 the total average daily recourse to the marginal lending facility amounted to OTHER OPERATIONS On 23 May 2003 the Eurosystem conducted a liquidity-absorbing fine-tuning operation in order to restore balanced liquidity conditions .
The large recourse to the marginal lending facility on the preceding two days had led to looser conditions on the last day of the maintenance period and to a decline in the overnight rate . The fine-tuning operation was conducted as a collection of fixed-term deposits with a fixed rate of 2.50% ( which was the minimum bid rate in MROs at that time ) , overnight maturity and a pre-announced intended allotment amount of Euros 5 billion .
On the assumption that the aggregate recourse takes place on the last day of the maintenance period while individual recourse takes place in the remainder of the period , these amounts may be broken down into Euros 49 million aggregate recourse and Euros 221 million individual recourse for the marginal lending facility , and Euros 107 million aggregate recourse and Euros 135 million individual recourse for the deposit facility .
Total recourse to the standing facilities in 2003 remained at the low levels of the previous year , indicating the good quality of the forecasts of the autonomous factors and the high efficiency of the interbank market .
PARTICIPATION OF CREDIT INSTITUTIONS IN MONETARY POLICY OPERATIONS The Eurosystem 's monetary policy framework continued to enable a broad range of credit institutions to participate in monetary policy operations .
Of the 6,593 euro area credit institutions which were subject to minimum reserves at the end of 2003 ( a change of - 5 % compared with the previous year ) , 2,149 (- 7 %) were eligible to participate in open market operations , 3,083 (- 5 %) were eligible to use the deposit facility and 2,629 (- 8 %) were eligible to use the marginal lending facility .
In 2003 the average number of credit institutions participating in the MROs and LTROs continued the declining trend which had started in mid-2000 .
In 2003 the average number of bidders in the MROs was 267 , compared with 307 in 2002 .
Similarly , the number of banks participating in the LTROs fell from 186 in 2002 to 133 in 2003 .
This trend seems to be the result of a combination of various factors , such as the competitiveness of the interbank market , the consolidation of the banking sector and the centralisation of treasury management in banking groups .
There is no sign that this continuous decline in MRO and LTRO participation has jeopardised the smooth allocation of central bank liquidity within the euro area banking system .
The Eurosystem continued to have more counterparties in its open market operations than any other central bank in the world .
MINIMUM RESERVE SYSTEM The Eurosystem 's minimum reserve system applies to credit institutions in the euro area and primarily pursues the aims of stabilising money market interest rates and creating ( or enlarging ) a structural liquidity shortage .
The reserve requirement of each institution is determined in relation to elements of its balance sheet .
The averaging provision , which allows credit institutions to fulfil their reserve requirements on average over the one-month reserve maintenance period 5 , helps to dampen the impact of temporary liquidity shocks on shortterm interest rates .
In 2003 reserve requirements represented 54 % of the total liquidity needs of the euro area banking system .
The average level of aggregate reserve requirements held by credit institutions in the euro area was Euros 130.9 billion in 2003 , representing a small increase of around Euros 1 billion compared with 2002 .
Reserve requirements ranged from Euros 128.9 billion in the maintenance period ending on 23 March 2003 to Euros 132.1 billion in the maintenance period ending on 23 August 2003 .
Banks Â» current account holdings covering reserve requirements fluctuated between Euros 89.1 billion and Euros 181.2 billion in the course of the year , indicating that a substantial further buffer against unexpected aggregate liquidity withdrawals was always available ( see the upper panel of Chart 28 ) .
Mainly owing to the averaging provision of the minimum reserve system , and taking into account the low frequency of open market operations , the volatility of the EONIA continued to be low in 2003 by international standards .
The standard deviation of daily changes in the EONIA was 14 basis points , 2 basis points higher than in 2002 . 5 From 10 March 2004 a reserve maintenance period no longer lasts one calendar month , but instead varies in length .
ECB Annual Report 2003 During 2003 an average of 19 cases of noncompliance with the obligation to hold minimum reserves were reported per reserve maintenance period , compared with 28 in 2002 .
The average daily shortfall amounted to Euros 6.7 million , compared with Euros 10.5 million in 2002 .
58 % of the cases led to relatively small penalties of below Euros 500 .
There were , however , seven very large infringements , which led to fines in excess of Euros 10,000 .
REVIEW OF THE OPERATIONAL FRAMEWORK In reaction to some occasional disturbances recorded in previous years , the Governing Council decided in January 2003 to amend some of the features of the Eurosystem 's operational framework with effect from March 2004 : -- to modify the timing of the reserve maintenance period so that it always starts on the settlement day of the MRO following the Governing Council meeting at which the monthly assessment of the monetary policy stance is scheduled .
Furthermore , as a rule , the implementation of changes to the standing facility rates is aligned with the start of the new reserve maintenance period ;
-- to shorten the maturity of the MROs from two weeks to one week . Combining both these measures will help to remove market expectations of interest rate changes during any given maintenance period , given that changes in the key ECB interest rates will only apply , in general , to the forthcoming reserve maintenance period and that liquidity conditions will no longer spill over from one reserve maintenance period to the next .
Consequently , within a maintenance period , the market overnight rate should no longer be affected by rate change expectations .
Hence , given the generally neutral liquidity management policy of the ECB , the overnight rate should remain close to the minimum bid rate .
This should eventually prevent speculative considerations from disrupting the bidding of credit institutions in MROs .
The measures will thus help to stabilise the conditions in which bidding takes place .
Owing to technical and legal lead times , it was decided that the changes would not enter into force until 10 March 2004 .
6 To help credit institutions to achieve a smooth implementation of the changes to the operational framework for monetary policy , an extended transitional minimum reserve maintenance period ( from 24 January to 9 March 2004 ) was agreed .
ELIGIBLE ASSETS FOR MONETARY POLICY OPERATIONS The Statute of the ESCB requires that all Eurosystem credit operations be covered by adequate collateral .
The collateral framework of the Eurosystem is designed to protect the Eurosystem against incurring losses in its monetary policy and payment systems operations ( see Box 7 ) .
It ensures the equal treatment of counterparties and enhances operational efficiency .
In order to take account of existing differences in the financial structure of euro area countries , assets eligible for Eurosystem credit operations include a large number of different instruments .
A distinction is made between two categories of assets eligible for these credit operations : Â« tier one Â» and Â« tier two Â» .
This distinction has no bearing on their eligibility for the various types of Eurosystem monetary policy operations , except that tier two assets are not normally expected to be used by the Eurosystem in outright transactions ( not conducted at present ) .
Tier one consists of marketable debt instruments fulfilling uniform eligibility criteria specified by the ECB .
Tier two consists of assets which are of particular importance for national financial markets and banking systems and for which eligibility criteria have been established by the NCBs , subject to minimum 6 A new Regulation ( ECB / 2003/9 ) on the application of minimum reserves was adopted on 12 September 2003 ( OJ L 250 , 2.10.2003 , p. 10 ) .
A revised version of the document entitled Â« The single monetary policy in the euro area : General documentation on Eurosystem monetary policy instruments and procedures Â» ( see footnote 1 ) applies from 8 March 2004 .

1 ) Securities issued by international and supranational institutions are not included .
2 ) This category includes Pfandbrief-style securities and uncovered bonds issued by credit institutions .
Tier two assets may be marketable or nonmarketable debt instruments or they may be equities . A substantial part of tier one assets is made up of government securities ( assets issued by central , regional and local governments ) and of Pfandbrief-style securities which are issued by credit institutions and backed by residential mortgages or by public sector debt .
At the end of 2003 government and Pfandbrief-style securities represented 57 % and 31 % respectively of the total tier one assets . Other types of asset included in tier one are private sector securities ( i.e. uncovered bonds issued by credit institutions , bonds issued by corporations and asset-backed securities other than Pfandbrief-style securities ) and securities issued by international and supranational institutions ( which accounted for less than 2 % at the end of 2003 ) .
In particular , the value of
eligible bonds issued by corporations followed a continuously increasing trend in 2003 .
Tier two consists of marketable assets and non-marketable debt instruments such as bank loans , trade bills and mortgage-backed promissory notes listed by some NCBs in that category . The total value of tier one assets eligible as collateral for Eurosystem credit operations was Euros 7 trillion at the end of 2003 , compared with Euros 6.6 trillion at the end of 2002 ( see Chart 29 ) .
Overall , tier one assets accounted for an overwhelming proportion of eligible assets ( 96 % at the end of 2003 ) . The total value of marketable tier two assets remained stable , standing at Euros 261 billion at the end of 2003 , compared with Euros 265 billion in 2002 .
( The absolute amount of eligible non-marketable tier two assets is not available . ) All Eurosystem credit operations are based on underlying assets provided by counterparties in

A continuously increasing path was observed for the share of corporate bonds , from 4 % ( end-2002 ) to 6 % ( end-2003 ) .
The share of non-marketable bank loans has been relatively stable at around 4 % of all assets put forward during the past five years .
Eurosystem counterparties may use eligible assets on a cross-border basis , i.e. they can obtain funds from the NCB of the country in which they are established by making use of assets located in another euro area country .
The share of cross-border collateral in total collateral put forward by counterparties for Eurosystem credit operations continued to increase , from 33 % at the end of 2002 to 40 % at the end of 2003 .
This increase involved all types of assets , but particularly those issued by credit institutions and corporations ( for more details see Section 2.3 of this chapter ) . 7
The total amount of collateral deposited by counterparties in pooling systems was around Euros 650 billion ( end-2003 ) , compared with approximately Euros 600 billion at the end of 2002 .
With regard to earmarking systems , where it is possible to identify the individual transaction for which the underlying assets are used , the total amount used by counterparties for Eurosystem credit operations ( monetary policy operations and intraday credit needs ) was Euros 107 billion at the end of 2003 , compared with Euros 115 billion at the end of 2002 .

Box 7
RISK MANAGEMENT RELATED TO THE PROVISION OF CREDIT IN MONETARY POLICY AND PAYMENT SYSTEMS OPERATIONS In policy operations ( i.e. monetary policy or payment systems credit operations ) , when the Eurosystem enters into a transaction with a counterparty , it incurs the risk that the counterparty may be unable to meet its credit obligations .
This credit risk is mitigated by the requirement that the counterparty provide adequate collateral to guarantee the credit provided .
The framework for managing the risks associated with the Eurosystem 's policy operations has three main components , namely the risk control of collateral , valuation principles and the credit risk assessment of collateral .
In the context of risk control of collateral , a new haircut schedule was finalised in 2003 .
The new haircut schedule aims to better differentiate between collateral types on the basis of their perceived liquidity risk characteristics .
The classification of collateral into liquidity groups is based on the examination of different liquidity indicators , such as yield curve differentials between bonds issued by issuer groups of the same credit quality , effective supply and average issue size as well as the bid-ask spread type of indicators .
The classification of issuer segments into groups of varying levels of liquidity is then reflected in the level of risk controls or haircuts .
The new tier one risk controls apply as of March 2004 . The main changes are as follows : -- Tier one assets are classified in four liquidity categories and each category is assigned a specific haircut schedule :
Category II Local and regional government debt instruments Jumbo Pfandbrief-style debt instruments Agency debt instruments Supranational debt instruments Category III Traditional Pfandbriefstyle debt instruments Credit institution debt instruments Debt instruments issued by corporate and other issuers
-- The maturity sectors of the haircut schedules have been chosen in such a way as to achieve an even distribution of outstanding volumes across sectors .
The new maturity sectors are 0-1 year , 1-3 years , 3-5 years , 5-7 years , 7-10 years and >10 years .
The application of initial margins has been discontinued and trigger levels used in margin calls reduced from 1.0% to 0.5% .
In order to guarantee coherence between the new valuation haircut schedules for tier
one eligible assets and those for tier two eligible assets , the latter have also been modified to take into account both the discontinuation of initial margins and the new maturity sectors .
-- The valuation haircuts applied to tier two assets reflect the specific risks associated with these assets and are at least as stringent as the haircuts applied to tier one assets .
The four different haircut groups for tier two assets , reflecting differences in their intrinsic characteristics and liquidity , have been maintained : equities , marketable debt instruments with limited liquidity , debt instruments with restricted liquidity and special features , and non-marketable debt instruments . The management and publication of the complete list of assets eligible for Eurosystem credit operations are handled centrally at the ECB , where the Eligible Assets Database is kept .
Assets are only considered eligible for Eurosystem credit operations when they appear in the list updated on a daily basis on the ECB 's website ( www.ecb.int ) . In 2003 the Eurosystem enhanced the quality , efficiency and reliability of the service provided to its counterparties and also modified the content of the list of eligible assets , providing additional information on the issuer group and the asset types in line with the new risk control framework applied from March 2004 ( see Box 7 ) .
THE SINGLE LIST OF COLLATERAL During the first five years of Stage Three of EMU , a large amount of collateral encompassing a wide range of assets was available to counterparties for collateralising Eurosystem monetary policy and intraday credit operations . However , the heterogeneity of the assets included in the tier two lists of different euro area NCBs may not ensure a level playingfield for counterparties and may somewhat decrease the transparency of the collateral framework .
The Eurosystem is therefore investigating whether and how this heterogeneity could be reduced and under what conditions the two tiers of assets could be merged in order to obtain a single list .
In June 2003 the Eurosystem launched a public consultation inviting market participants to submit their views on possible changes to the Eurosystem 's collateral framework .
The basic idea put forward to market participants was to gradually move from a two-tier system to a single list .
The assets already accepted as collateral by the Eurosystem under tier one would be part of the single list .
The main categories of currently eligible tier two assets were reviewed with a view to their potential inclusion in the single list .
In addition , a new category of assets to be made eligible was investigated , namely euro-denominated debt instruments issued in the EEA by issuers established in non-EEA G10 countries .
Replies were received from various interested parties , including individual banks , associations of market participants and some national and supranational banking associations .
Almost all replies supported the proposal to replace the two-tier system with a single list of eligible collateral .
Support for the reform is largely based on the desire to establish a harmonised collateral framework that enhances the level playing-field between eligible counterparties .
Market participants argued that the new collateral policy should favour greater availability of eligible assets because of the increased use of collateral in the market , e.g. in secured lending and repo markets , and for the purposes of Continuous Linked Settlement ( CLS ) ( see Section 4 of Chapter 3 ) . Some market participants
83 highlighted the need to make eligible in the whole euro area all categories of assets currently accepted in tier two by only some NCBs .
Some of them also mentioned additional categories of assets that they would welcome as eligible ( e.g. more Â« foreign Â» assets such as debt instruments denominated in foreign currencies ) .
The Eurosystem is aware that the revised collateral framework ( if and when decided ) will require gradual implementation over a number of years .
This will be necessary in the light of the required adaptation of operational systems and procedures , both of the Eurosystem 's central banks and of counterparties , as well as legislative adjustments to be made in some countries .
MARKET CONTACT GROUPS The ECB continued to use the Money Market Contact Group ( MMCG ) and the Foreign Exchange Contact Group ( FXCG ) , both established in 1999 , as well as the Operations Managers Group ( OMG ) , established in 2002 , as fora for discussing market developments , structural market issues and trading practices as well as operational issues related to money market and foreign exchange settlement .
Among the issues discussed with market participants in the MMCG in 2003 were those related to the 2002 review of the euro money market , the European repo market , the ACI initiative on the Short-Term European Paper ( STEP ) project ( see Section 3 of Chapter 3 ) and the ECB 's consultation on the Eurosystem 's collateral framework .
The FXCG discussed issues such as the progress of the recently established CLS , developments in e-commerce and a possible review of market practices . transactions by the IMF on behalf of the ECB with other SDR holders was activated on one occasion in 2003 .
1.3 INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES FOREIGN RESERVE MANAGEMENT The aim of the management of the ECB 's foreign reserves is to ensure that , at any given point in time , the ECB has an adequate amount of liquid resources at its disposal for any foreign exchange intervention , if and when the Governing Council decides that intervention is necessary .
Liquidity and security are therefore the basic requirements for the investment of the ECB 's foreign reserves .
Subject to these constraints , the ECB 's foreign reserves are managed in such a way as to maximise their return .
A set of rules and procedures -- known as a Chinese wall -- have been established to prevent inside information , for instance originating from the areas responsible for monetary policy implementation , from reaching the areas responsible for the management of the ECB 's foreign reserves and own funds portfolio .
At the end of 2003 the ECB 's net foreign reserve assets amounted to Euros 38.3 billion , compared with Euros 43.2 billion at the end of 2002 .
The change in the size of the foreign reserve portfolio during 2003 reflects the interest income earned and the change in the market value of the assets in the portfolio , as a result of the depreciation of the US dollar .
The ECB can make further calls on the euro area NCBs Â» foreign reserve assets under the conditions defined in secondary Community legislation 8 .
The ECB 's foreign reserves mainly consist of US dollars but also include Japanese yen , gold and SDRs .
The currency distribution , which is defined by the Governing Council , is based on optimal currency allocation studies and 8 Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1010/2000 of 8 May 2000 concerning further calls of foreign reserve assets by the European Central Bank ( OJ L 115 , 16.5.2000 , p. 2 ) .
1.2 FOREIGN EXCHANGE OPERATIONS In 2003 the ECB did not conduct any interventions in the foreign exchange market .
The standing agreement between the ECB and the IMF , signed in April 2001 , to facilitate the initiation of special drawing rights ( SDR ) 84
prospective operational needs , and the Governing Council may change it when it deems appropriate .
In line with the Central Bank Gold Agreement of 26 September 1999 , renewed on 8 March 2004 , the ECB 's gold assets are not managed actively .
OWN FUNDS MANAGEMENT The subscribed capital and general accounting reserve of the ECB form the basis of the ECB 's own funds portfolio .
The purpose of the own funds portfolio is to provide the ECB with a reserve to meet possible losses .
The objective of portfolio management is to generate returns over the long term in excess of the average main refinancing rate of the ECB .
At the end of 2003 the ECB 's own funds portfolio amounted to Euros 5.9 billion , compared with Euros 5.6 billion at the end of 2002 .
The change in the size of the own funds portfolio during 2003 reflects the interest income earned and the change in the market value of the assets in the portfolio .
In 2003 further possible diversification opportunities were examined with the aim of improving the total return on the own funds portfolio .
RISK MANAGEMENT ISSUES The ECB 's risk management function measures , monitors and reports all risks resulting from financial operations undertaken by the ECB directly or by the 12 NCBs of the Eurosystem on behalf of the ECB .
The framework for managing the risks associated with the management of the ECB 's foreign reserves and the ECB 's own funds has three key interrelated components : ( i ) risk management measurement and compliance , ( ii ) the analysis and reporting of investment performance and ( iii ) the analytical framework for asset allocation .
The ECB 's exposure to market , credit and liquidity risk is measured and compliance with agreed limits verified on a daily basis .
In 2003 no serious breaches occurred .
The monitoring of compliance in 2003 focused increasingly on ensuring the correct liquidity profile of investments .
Liquidity limits for the ECB 's foreign reserves were formally introduced to ensure that adequate amounts of assets are held in cash or highly liquid securities .
Clear procedures are in place for reporting and dealing with any breaches of these or other limits .
2003 also saw improvements to the procedures to verify the accuracy of the daily mark-to-market prices ( the prices of securities , recorded on a daily basis and used for valuation purposes ) .
The measurement and analysis of the performance of all the relevant investment portfolios forms a large part of the risk management work .
The current framework has 24 separate portfolios for foreign reserve management alone , as each of the euro area NCBs manages two portfolios of the ECB 's foreign reserves .
Techniques to attribute performance -- i.e. to identify the sources of portfolio returns in relation to the investment benchmarks set by the ECB -- were further developed in 2003 in order to provide useful feedback for portfolio managers .
Aggregating these data over longer periods also allows more detailed conclusions to be drawn .
This analysis of overall performance as well as the relative performance of portfolios against the relevant benchmark can also be useful for the decisionmaking bodies in deciding on any modification of the overall investment framework .
Asset allocation is the process of dividing investments among different kinds of asset to optimise , on the basis of the institution 's goals , the trade-off between risk and reward .
The key factor influencing the return on the investment portfolios is the asset allocation of the ECB 's strategic benchmarks . These are designed to reflect the ECB 's long-term risk-return preferences .
In 2003 the ECB developed an econometric model to derive expected returns for the setting of benchmarks .
In addition , several alternative optimisation techniques were used to enhance the robustness of the analysis .
2 P AY M E N T A N D S E C U R I T I E S S E T T L E M E N T SYSTEMS The provision of payment and securities settlement facilities is one of the Eurosystem 's main instruments for carrying out its task of promoting the smooth operation of payment systems .
To fulfil its statutory task , the Eurosystem has created the TARGET9 system , a real-time gross settlement ( RTGS ) system for very large payments in euro .
Payments through TARGET are settled in the books of central banks , in central bank money , which greatly minimises the risk of failures with critical systemic consequences for the entire financial system .
TARGET has been subject to enhancements over the past few years , and plans are under way to develop a secondgeneration system , TARGET2 .
On the securities settlement side , the Eurosystem and the market offer various channels to facilitate the use of collateral across national borders .
The use of these channels is increasing with the growing integration of EU markets .
payments in euro was executed via TARGET .
TARGET is available for all credit transfers in euro between banks in an EU Member State ( intra-Member State traffic ) and between banks in different EU Member States ( inter-Member State traffic ) , including those that have not yet adopted the euro .
In 2003 there were 3,351 participants in TARGET . 43,450 bank branches worldwide can be addressed through TARGET .
TARGET OPERATIONS TARGET processed a daily average of 261,208 payments with a total value of Euros 1,650 billion a day in 2003 . Compared with 2002 , this is an increase of 3 % in volume and 6 % in value .
Out of the total TARGET traffic in 2003 , interMember State traffic represented 33 % in terms of value and 23 % in terms of volume , compared with 31 % and 21 % respectively in 2002 .
Of the TARGET inter-Member State traffic , 95 % in terms of value and 52 % in terms of volume were interbank payments , the remainder being customer payments .
The average value of an inter-Member State interbank payment was Euros 17 million , and the average value of an inter-Member State customer payment was Euros 0.8 million .
Further information is provided in Table 12 .
In 2003 the overall availability of TARGET , i.e. the possibility for participants to use TARGET during its business hours without incident , reached 99.79% .
The TARGET Information System ( TIS ) was enhanced in 2003 so that TARGET users can be provided with more detailed and timely information in the event of an incident .
2.1 THE TARGET SYSTEM The present TARGET system is built on the 15 national payment systems of the EU . It also includes the payment mechanism of the ECB , the EPM , and an interlinking mechanism that enables the processing of cross-border payments .
In 2003 TARGET contributed further to the integration of the euro money market and , because the Eurosystem 's credit operations are processed via this system , continued to play an important role in the smooth implementation of the single monetary policy .
On account of its real-time settlement service in central bank money and its broad market coverage , the TARGET system attracts a variety of other payments .
TARGET functioned smoothly and successfully in 2003 , and continued its trend of settling increasingly more large-value euro payments in line with the Eurosystem 's policy objective to promote settlement in central bank money .
Table 12 Payment traffic in TARGET 1 ) Change (%) 3 3 1 1 11 11 Change (%) 6 6 4 4 11 11 Volume Overall Total Daily average Intra-Member State Total Daily average Inter-Member State Total Daily average Value ( EUR billions ) Overall Total Daily average Intra-Member State Total Daily average Inter-Member State Total Daily average
( sometimes involving commercial banks ) verified the operability and interoperability of all contingency measures alongside the whole TARGET payment processing chain .
As a result , the Eurosystem is today better positioned to ensure that payment systems and financial markets can continue to function smoothly in a crisis situation .
OTHER CHANGES Changes in the communication network of SWIFT , such as the SWIFTNet FIN migration , are mandatory for the entire user community .
The components of TARGET may implement the changes at their own pace , but must have completed the changeover by the end of 2004 .
NIGHT-TIME SETTLEMENT FACILITIES In 2003 the Eurosystem responded to a market move in securities settlement systems ( SSSs ) towards settling transfers of financial instruments during the night , in what are known as overnight settlement cycles . In these settlement cycles , SSS operators bring forward to the previous night some of the activities that would typically occur on the following business day .
Overnight settlement has the advantage that SSS participants can have certainty with regard to their actual positions in cash and securities , and can operate on this basis at the start of daytime operations .
Meeting a specific market request , the Governing Council has approved a model which supports the cross-border settlement of the payment legs of overnight settlement cycles in central bank money for participants established outside the country of the system in which they participate .
The solution developed by the Eurosystem relies on bilateral guarantees between euro area central banks . These guarantees involve the NCB of the country where the system is located and the NCBs of participants who are established outside that country .
1 ) 255 operating days in 2002 and 2003 .
PROVISIONS FOR SYSTEMICALLY IMPORTANT PAYMENTS IN TARGET Owing to the specific role the TARGET system plays in the market and the broad market coverage it provides , suitable protection against a wide range of threats is essential for the smooth functioning of the system . Consequently , security issues need to be properly addressed within the TARGET environment .
A methodology for assessing the risk situation has been in place since the development phase of the TARGET system .
In 2003 the existing risk management process was revised substantially . The new TARGET Risk Management Framework is based on international standards .
In abnormal circumstances it is of utmost importance that systemically important payments , i.e. those that could cause a systemic risk if not processed immediately , be carried out without delay . Established TARGET contingency measures have been further enhanced to ensure that this is the case .
guarantees between NCBs make it possible for participants to use their central bank reserve balances at their home central bank for overnight settlement in an SSS outside their home country .
RELATIONS WITH TARGET USERS AND RTGS OPERATORS OF OTHER CURRENCY AREAS The ESCB maintains close relations with TARGET users so as to ensure that their needs are given due consideration and receive an appropriate response .
As in previous years , regular meetings were held in 2003 between the EU central banks and the national TARGET user groups .
In addition , joint meetings of the TARGET Management Working Group ( TMWG ) of the ESCB and the TARGET Working Group ( TWG ) of the European banking industry were held to discuss TARGET operational issues . Strategic issues were addressed in the Contact Group on Euro Payments Strategy ( COGEPS ) , a forum in which the senior management of commercial and central banks is represented .
The Eurosystem , as operator of one of the largest RTGS systems in the world , maintains close contacts with the RTGS operators of other currency areas .
Increasing interrelations , e.g. due to Continuous Linked Settlement ( CLS ) operations , have created the need for common discussions on operational issues .
On 24 October 2002 the Governing Council set out the principles which have since guided the preparation of the TARGET2 system .
The new system must ( i ) provide an extensively harmonised service level , ( ii ) apply a single TARGET-wide price structure to these harmonised services and ( iii ) guarantee costeffectiveness .
At the same time , the NCBs will remain responsible for the accounts of , and business relations with , credit institutions in their respective Member States .
As regards the technical infrastructure of TARGET2 , central banks will be able to share a technical platform , the single shared platform ( SSP ) , supporting the RTGS services that they offer to their banks .
The planning for the TARGET2 project is divided into three main phases : the pre-project phase , the project phase , and the testing and trial operations phase .
2003 was dedicated to the pre-project phase , in which three main work streams have to be addressed before technical development work can start in the course of 2004 .
The first work stream is the definition of the core features and functions offered by TARGET2 ( e.g. payment processing and settlement services , interface issues , liquidity management , information services , business continuity and security ) .
The second work stream on cost and pricing issues consists mainly of the finalisation of a common cost methodology for TARGET2 .
The third work stream focuses on issues specifically related to the SSP .
As a first step in the definition of the core features and functions of TARGET2 , the Eurosystem launched a public consultation in December 2002 to collect the views of the entire community of TARGET users on the approach to be chosen for TARGET2 as well as on its service level .
10 A summary of all replies , together with the individual contributions , was made available on the ECB 's website on 14 July 2003 .
11 Â« Summary of comments received on TARGET2 : principles and structure Â» , ECB , July 2003 . 2.2 TARGET2 The current structure of TARGET was decided on in 1994 and was based on the principles of minimum harmonisation and interconnection of existing infrastructures .
Eurosystem 's initiative to improve the functionality and performance of TARGET . The banking industry also stressed the importance of users being involved in the TARGET2 project .
The ESCB will continue to consult the banking community on relevant TARGET2 issues throughout the project . In addition , the contributions received in the public consultation have served as a basis for determining the features and functions of TARGET2 .
Current preparations are also focused on ensuring the full compliance of the future TARGET2 system with the Core Principles for Systemically Important Payment Systems 12 , which were adopted as minimum standards by the Governing Council .
With regard to the second work stream , a common cost methodology for TARGET2 to be applied by all central banks had to be developed .
It will serve as the basis for the determination of the single TARGET2-wide price structure and will also be used to establish whether the cost recovery requirement has been complied with .
As for the third work stream , which focuses on issues related to the SSP , the ECB has coordinated the discussions between the central banks interested in participating in the SSP .
The Eurosystem has started to address issues related to the governance structure and financing of the SSP .
The Banca d' Italia , the Banque de France and the Deutsche Bundesbank have launched a joint initiative for the development of the SSP .
In addition to these three work streams , an adequate project organisation will have to be established in 2004 to ensure both the effective organisation of the development work in the project phase and an appropriate level of involvement of , and control by , all central banks that intend to participate in the SSP .
Preparations at the ESCB level aim to start TARGET2 operations on 2 January 2007 .
However , this deadline is very tight and will be subject to a further feasibility analysis at a later stage in the pre-project phase .
2.3 USE OF ELIGIBLE ASSETS ACROSS NATIONAL BORDERS Eligible assets may be used across national borders to collateralise all types of Eurosystem credit operations by means of the correspondent central banking model ( CCBM ) or through eligible links between EU SSSs .
The CCBM is provided by the Eurosystem , while eligible links are a market-led solution .
The amount of cross-border collateral held by the Eurosystem increased from Euros 234 billion in December 2002 to Euros 305 billion in December 2003 .
Overall , at the end of 2003 cross-border collateral represented 40 % of the total collateral provided to the Eurosystem . This is a clear indication of the increasing integration of financial markets in the euro area .
As a result of this process , counterparties are increasingly inclined to hold in their portfolio assets located in another euro area country .
THE CORRESPONDENT CENTRAL BANKING MODEL The CCBM has remained the main channel for transferring cross-border collateral and has been enhanced further . Eurosystem counterparties may use eligible assets on a cross-border basis , i.e. they can obtain funds from the NCB of the country in which they are established by making use of assets located in another euro area country .
Assets held in custody through the CCBM increased from Euros 195 billion at the end of 2002 to Euros 259 billion at the end of 2003 .

Box 8
BEST PRACTICES FOR MARKET PARTICIPANTS INVOLVED IN CCBM OPERATIONS AS AGREED BY THE EUROPEAN BANKING FEDERATION , THE EUROPEAN SAVINGS BANK GROUP AND THE EUROPEAN ASSOCIATION OF CO-OPERATIVE BANKS 1 .
Custodians shall ensure that their customers are informed of their rules / procedures for CCBM-related instructions .
These rules / procedures shall be based , to the largest extent possible , on the official local market practices .
Under normal circumstances and on a best effort basis , custodians shall submit their customers Â» CCBM-related instructions to the local SSS within 30 minutes of their receipt provided that the instructions are complete and correct , and that the customer has the securities to be delivered .
Custodian deadlines for same-day processing of their customers Â» CCBM-related instructions shall be 30 minutes before the deadline of the relevant local SSS ( see the regularly updated country tables on the ECB 's website at http://www.ecb.int ) .
However , as good practice , customers are encouraged to submit their instructions well in advance of the custodian 's deadline in order to avoid building up instruction queues and to provide the custodian with sufficient time to react to mistakes or unforeseen problems .
Custodians shall agree with their customers on solutions for recognising and prioritising ( when necessary ) CCBM-related instructions .
These solutions should be based on ISO 15022 standards where available .
Provided that there are ways for custodians to recognise CCBM instructions as such , they shall inform their customers , on a best effort basis , of settlement problems within 15 minutes of their discovery .
In order to improve the service level provided by the CCBM , the Governing Council decided at the end of 2002 that , as of January 2004 , NCBs would perform internal CCBM procedures within an hour , provided that counterparties ( and their custodians ) submit their instructions correctly . However , deviation
from this one-hour benchmark will be tolerated in certain circumstances , for instance in the case of peak traffic .
As custodian banks often play an important role in the CCBM processing chain by delivering the collateral on behalf of the counterpart , the major
European credit sector associations ( the European Banking Federation , the European Savings Bank Group and the European Association of Co-operative Banks ) have established Â« best practices Â» for custodian banks involved in CCBM transactions . These provide market participants with guidelines for optimising the efficiency of the CCBM .
The best practices , presented in Box 8 , apply as of January 2004 .
ELIGIBLE LINKS BETWEEN NATIONAL SECURITIES SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS National SSSs can be linked by means of contractual and operational arrangements to allow the cross-border transfer of assets between systems .
14 Once securities have been transferred via such links to another SSS , they can be used through local procedures in the same way as any domestic collateral .
66 links are currently available to counterparties , of which only a limited number are actively used . Furthermore , these links only cover part of the euro area , and no new links were presented for assessment in 2003 .
Collateral held through links increased from Euros 38 billion in December 2002 to Euros 46 billion in December 2003 , but represented only 6 % of the total collateral , cross-border and domestic , held by the Eurosystem .

3 BANKNOTES AND COINS 3.1 THE CIRCULATION OF EURO BANKNOTES AND COINS AND THE HANDLING OF CURRENCY DEMAND FOR EURO BANKNOTES AND COINS The substantial increase in euro banknotes in circulation which was observed throughout 2002 after the initial cash changeover period continued during 2003 . Between January and December 2003 , the value of euro banknotes in circulation increased by 21.7% , from Euros 358.5 billion to Euros 436.2 billion .
Only in January 2003 did the value of euro banknotes in circulation decrease markedly , by 5.3% compared with December 2002 , due to the reduced cash needs of economic agents after the turn of the year in line with the normal annual cycle .
In February the value of euro banknotes in circulation picked up again , rising constantly at an average monthly growth rate of around 2.1% during the rest of the year .
The increase in demand for euro banknotes is a result of their increased use both as a store of value and as a parallel currency in countries outside the euro area .
Statistical analyses have revealed that as at end-December 2003 some 9 % of the value of euro banknotes in circulation was held by non-euro area residents .
The number of euro banknotes in circulation also rose markedly , by 10.1% , in 2003 .
Following a drop of 8.6% , from 8.2 billion to 7.5 billion banknotes , in January 2003 , the number rose Chart 32 Total value of banknotes in circulation between 2000 and 2003 ( EUR billions ) national banknotes euro banknotes 10 450 450 400 400 350 350 300 300 250 250 200 200 150 150 100 100 50 50 0 0 Jan.

moderately throughout the year , with seasonal peaks around the summer and towards the end of the year , when a level of 9.0 billion banknotes was reached . Chart 32 shows the development of national banknotes and euro banknotes in circulation in terms of value from 2000 to 2003 , while Chart 33 shows the development in terms of volume in 2002 and 2003 .
No significant shifts between individual banknote denominations occurred in 2003 , as can be seen in Chart 34 .
A closer look at the development of the annual growth rates for the individual denominations reveals significant growth for the higher banknote denominations . The increase in the issuance of Euros 500 banknotes was strongest , with the number in circulation rising from 167 million to 238 million in 2003 , an annual growth rate of 42.5% .
The number of Euros 50 , Euros 100 and Euros 200 banknotes in circulation also increased significantly , with annual growth rates of 19.0% , 20.3% and 12.1% respectively , while the increase in the lower-value banknotes was moderate : 2.3% for the Euros 5 banknote , 2.5% for the Euros 10 banknote and 4.0% for the Euros 20 banknote .
A lasting upswing in the demand for euro coins was observed in all euro area countries from January 2003 onwards , resulting in an increase in the value of coins in circulation of 13.7% , from Euros 12.4 billion to Euros 14.1 billion as at end-December 2003 .

circulation increased by 9.1 billion in the course of the year , from 39.9 billion to 49.0 billion coins by the end of 2003 .
The significant rise was mainly due to the increased demand for low-value coins , i.e. 1 cent , 2 cent and 5 cent coins , which accounted for more than twothirds of this increase .
This can be explained by hoarding and the relatively high loss rates for these denominations .
BANKNOTE HANDLING BY THE EUROSYSTEM Banknotes returned to the NCBs are fully authenticated and quality checked with sophisticated banknote-processing machines to establish whether they are fit for further use .
Between January and December 2003 the number of euro banknotes crossing NCBs Â» counters totalled 57.8 billion , with a face value of Euros 1,744 billion , consisting of 28.5 billion banknotes deposited and 29.3 billion withdrawn by credit institutions and other clients .
Some 2.7 billion banknotes needed to be destroyed because they were unfit for further use .
This proportion is generally in line with NCBs Â» experience with the legacy banknotes after a similar period from their launch .
3.2 DEVELOPMENTS IN EURO BANKNOTE COUNTERFEITS AND COUNTERFEIT DETERRENCE EURO BANKNOTE COUNTERFEITS In 2002 , when the euro banknotes were new , the level of counterfeiting was exceptionally low . This was partly because of the sophisticated security elements in the euro banknotes , but also because counterfeiters had not had much time to adjust to the new banknotes .
In 2003 , the banknotes Â» second year of use , the number of counterfeits detected was inevitably higher than in the previous year .
The total number of counterfeits received by National Analysis Centres ( NACs ) 15 during 2003 was 551,287 .
The euro remains a well protected currency . However , the reproduction technology available to counterfeiters gets better and cheaper over time .
In addition , the euro is a widely used international currency , which makes it more prone to counterfeiting .
Overall , the counterfeiting rate did not show a steady increase in 2003 , but there were some seasonal fluctuations coinciding with periods of high circulation of genuine banknotes , namely the Christmas and summer holiday seasons . 15 Centres established in each EU Member State for the initial analysis of counterfeit euro banknotes at the national level .
The distribution of counterfeiting across the denominations was as follows : Euros 5 Quantity Percentage 2,733 0.5 Euros 100 Quantity Percentage 53,668 9.7 Euros 10 5,476 1.0 Euros 200 14,776 2.7 Euros 20 152,061 27.6 Euros 500 950 0.2 Euros 50 321,623 58.3 Total 551,286 100.0
Although the Euros 50 banknote remains the counterfeiters Â» favourite target , by comparison with last year there has been a significant shift away from the Euros 50 towards the Euros 20 banknote .
The media have drawn attention to the existence of high-quality counterfeits , but the number of such counterfeits is extremely small and the Â« feel-look-tilt Â» test for counterfeits remains sufficient to detect almost all cases .
COUNTERFEIT DETERRENCE In addition to the cooperation agreement concluded with Europol during 2002 , the ECB concluded similar agreements in 2003 with Interpol and with several acceding country central banks ( ACCBs ) .
The ECB and the NCBs have also been active in training cash-handling professionals , both in the EU and beyond , in recognising and handling counterfeit banknotes .
The Counterfeit Analysis Centre at the ECB and the NACs collaborate with the police in the fight against counterfeiting , and technicians from the NACs provide , upon request , legal authorities with expert advice and technical reports . Furthermore , the Eurosystem has increased its contribution to the global cooperation on counterfeit deterrence under the auspices of the G10 governors .
The ECB has developed a technical support structure called the Â« International Counterfeit Deterrence Centre Â» ( ICDC ) for the international community .
The ICDC updates the threat analysis through continuous evaluation of new reproduction equipment and counterfeit deterrence systems .
ENSURING THE FUTURE INTEGRITY OF THE EURO BANKNOTES Security features Â« age Â» from the moment of issue . As counterfeiters Â» awareness of an initially sound security feature increases , so does the risk of that feature being reproduced .
The euro , as other world currencies , experienced this phenomenon after its launch and increasingly during 2003 . This threat increases as other banknote design authorities adopt the euro as a technical standard and opt for similar security features .
Therefore , the research and development ( R & D ) of new security features play an important role in ensuring the future integrity of euro banknotes .
In the pursuit of new security features that represent a paradigm change in the longer term , the Eurosystem has developed a methodology to assess and fund R & D proposals on the widest possible basis . The research on new security features is supplemented by development programmes that bridge the gap between research and production .
3.3 BANKNOTE ISSUANCE AND PRODUCTION THE EUROSYSTEM' S ROLE IN THE CASH CYCLE The Governing Council has on various occasions underlined the importance of a level playing-field for cash services .
A number of measures have already been taken with a view to contributing to a fair competitive environment .
In 2002 a common Eurosystem fee policy was implemented for the cash transactions of professional clients at NCB counters and a common approach to opening hours and debiting / crediting rules for cash services at NCB counters was also defined .
In addition , terms of reference for the use of cash-recycling machines 16 in the euro area were published . In 2003 a common procedure for testing such machines was established .
Tests conducted according to this common procedure at any euro area NCB are valid in all euro area countries . The test procedures set a high standard for these 16 Cash-recycling machines are stand-alone , customer-operated devices capable of receiving , processing and dispensing banknotes .
machines concerning the retention of counterfeit / suspected banknotes and the separation of unfit banknotes in order to contribute to the high quality of the banknotes in circulation . Due attention has also been paid to the feasibility and technical capabilities of such machines .
Several manufacturers have already successfully completed these tests , thus contributing to high standards for banknote processing and recycling .
In addition to the measures already in place , the Eurosystem continues to discuss further aspects of the cash cycle with the objective of ensuring a smooth and efficient supply of cash and maintaining the integrity of the euro banknotes .
The ECB and the European Commission jointly organise biannual meetings in which matters of interest related to the use of cash are addressed . Participants include representatives from the banking industry , from consumer and retail groups , as well as from the vending-machine and cash-in-transit industries .
The ECB also participates , as an observer , in the Cash Working Group under the umbrella of the European Payments Council , which has been established by the European Credit Sector Associations and the major banks .
PRODUCTION ARRANGEMENTS AND FUTURE BANKNOTE PRODUCTION In April 2001 the Governing Council decided that in the following few years production of euro banknotes would take place in accordance with a decentralised production scenario with pooling .
The Governing Council has carried out a Table 13 Allocation of euro banknote production in 2003 Denomination Euros 5 Euros 10 Euros 20 Euros 50 Euros 100 Euros 200 Euros 500 Total Quantity ( millions of banknotes ) 110 999.1 1,071.1 657 122 133 0 1 ) 3,092.2 NCB commissioning production FR DE , GR , IE , AT FR , ES , NL , PT , DE IT , BE , ES , NL IT , FI DE , LU
1 ) The logistical stocks of Euros 500 banknotes resulting from the launch production were deemed to be sufficient to cover the needs for 2003 .
thorough analysis of whether tender procedures might be applied in the medium term for the procurement of raw materials and the production of euro banknotes .
The Governing Council has decided that a common Eurosystem competitive approach with tendering will be fully implemented by 2012 at the latest . The NCBs with in-house / public printing works will be allowed to opt out of this common approach .
SUPPORT FOR THE PRODUCTION OF EURO COINS The Member States are responsible for the production of euro coins .
The ECB continued to act as an independent assessor of the quality of minted coins .
This included the continued support and maintenance of a common quality management system in all mints producing euro coins .
The production of coins in 2003 was 4.8 billion ( 6.2 billion in 2002 ) .
SECOND SERIES OF EURO BANKNOTES The main aim of upgrading currency designs is to keep pace with technical developments in order to make sure that the banknotes have a continually high level of protection against counterfeiting , while containing security features that the public can recognise .
Banknote-issuing authorities therefore tend to gradually upgrade banknotes after a few years of circulation .
In line with this practice , the ECB has started planning a second series of euro banknotes , which will take several years to produce and issue .
95 An issue date for the second series of euro banknotes has not yet been defined , but it is expected to be towards the end of this decade .
The banknotes will be issued denomination by denomination , with certain intervals between releases , so that it will take several years before all denominations have been introduced .
The design of the second series will be based on the Â« ages and styles Â» theme of the current series in order to signal continuity .
VERY LOW-DENOMINATION BANKNOTES Since the completion of the cash changeover , there have been suggestions that it would be useful to introduce very low-denomination banknotes , i.e. of Euros 1 and / or Euros 2 . It has been argued that in some countries the population was accustomed to using low-value banknotes with their former currencies and has found it difficult to adapt to the comparably high banknote / coin boundary between the Euros 2 coin and Euros 5 banknote .
It has also been argued that consumers tend to associate coins with low values .
The Governing Council has agreed to reassess the possible issuance of very low-denomination banknotes in autumn 2004 , when more experience regarding the use of euro banknotes and coins has been gained , both inside and outside the euro area .
4 N E W A N D I M P R O V E D S TAT I S T I C S The ECB , assisted by the NCBs , collects a wide range of statistics which enable the ESCB to fulfil its tasks .
As in previous years , the provision of statistics proceeded smoothly in 2003 . However , the ECB and the NCBs consider that further improvements of the statistics are still necessary .
In 2003 numerous efforts were made to improve the availability and quality of statistics for the euro area , while aiming to minimise the reporting burden on reporting entities .
Progress has also been made with regard to the statistics which are used intensively by the ECB and which are collected and compiled by the European Commission ( Eurostat ) and the national statistical institutes ( NSIs ) .
items , e.g. write-offs / write-downs of loans , used in the calculation of the credit counterpart to the monetary aggregates are now available separately on a harmonised basis .
Following the adoption of Guideline ECB / 2002/7 on the statistical reporting requirements of the ECB in the field of quarterly financial accounts in 2002 , supplementary data on both the transactions and the balance sheets of insurance corporations and pension funds have been made available to the ECB since February 2003 .
In the field of statistics on non-MFIs other than insurance corporations and pension funds , data on the balance sheets of investment funds , including a detailed breakdown by type , were published for the first time in January 2003 .
These quarterly statistics are compiled on the basis of data currently available at the national level and are not yet fully harmonised across the euro area .
In addition , since January 2003 monthly data on quoted shares issued by euro area residents , broken down by issuing sector , have been made available .
An improved method for the calculation of growth rates for debt securities has also been used since January 2003 .
For euro area statistics compiled by Eurostat , the most important new statistics were the first publication of GDP flash estimates , based on a sub-set of countries producing early estimates , and of industrial new order statistics . As part of the further integration of statistics , the ECB published for the first time in June 2003 the monetary presentation of the balance of payments ( b.o.p. ) .
In this context , the collection of separate ECB Annual Report 2003
4.1 NEW STATISTICS In December 2003 the ECB published new harmonised statistics on the interest rates of monetary financial institutions ( MFIs ) .
These new statistics cover 45 indicators of euro area interest rates applied by MFIs to their deposit and lending business vis-Ã -vis households and non-financial corporations ( see also Section 2.1 of Chapter 1 ) .
The monthly interest rate statistics cover both outstanding amounts and new business . They provide a comprehensive and harmonised picture of the level of interest rates applied by MFIs , how they change over time and the business volumes associated with these rates .
The requirements for MFI interest rate statistics are laid down in Regulation ECB / 2001/18 .
All information , including the manual on MFI interest rates and methodological notes , is available on the ECB 's website .
Since September 2003 the ECB has published additional details on monetary aggregates and their counterparts .
Seasonally adjusted estimates now cover the whole consolidated balance sheet of the MFI sector .
In addition , the frequency of the data on the sectoral breakdown of deposits , loans and holdings of securities was increased from quarterly to monthly .
Revaluations of selected MFI balance sheet
information on loans and deposits within the other investment account will also make it easier to monitor developments in the liquid assets held abroad by the non-MFI sector .
-- Improving the dissemination of statistics .
-- Promoting timely and high-quality economic data for the euro area , as compiled by Eurostat on the basis of contributions by NSIs , e.g. by implementing the Â« first for Europe Â» principle , which encourages NSIs to give priority to their contribution to areawide data , in particular the Principal European Economic Indicators , and to a better coordination of , for example , release calendars and revision policies .
-- Actively participating in international standard-setting fora , with the aim of achieving greater consistency in basic data in the different types of statistics collected from companies .
As a way of improving the dissemination of statistics , since August 2003 the ECB has published a monthly Statistics Pocket Book , which provides the most important , up-to-date statistics on the euro area in a handy format .
4.2 THE MEDIUM-TERM STRATEGY FOR STATISTICS In 2003 the ECB statistical work followed a medium-term strategy to enhance statistics and improve their integration and dissemination .
Core elements of this strategy are : -- Preparing and incorporating the data on acceding countries , first as EU members and in the future as members of the euro area .
-- Creating an integrated system of quarterly financial and non-financial accounts for the euro area and enhancing the conceptual and numerical coherence of the data framework used for economic and monetary analysis .
The quarterly system of accounts will be compiled both for the whole euro area economy and for various institutional sectors . -- Further expanding ECB statistics .
This includes a Centralised Securities Database ( CSDB ) and a Financial Markets Database for the euro area , which will support the production of consistent and accurate statistics on securities markets and financial markets . The CSDB will also help to produce more accurate portfolio investment figures in the b.o.p. and international investment position ( i.i.p. ) statistics .
-- Extending the statistical framework for the monitoring and analysis of financial stability .
-- Monitoring and responding to financial innovations and other developments with potentially important implications for statistics , such as the new International Accounting Standards and the Basel Capital Accord .
4.3 IMPROVEMENTS IN THE INSTITUTIONAL AND LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR STATISTICS The ECB , together with the NCBs and in cooperation with other European and international institutions , also works towards the strengthening of the legal and institutional framework for the collection , compilation and dissemination of statistics .
The ECB has updated the Guideline concerning certain statistical reporting requirements of the ECB and the procedures for reporting by the NCBs of statistical information in the field of money and banking statistics ( published as Guideline ECB / 2003/2 ) .
The ECB has also updated the Regulation concerning the provision of MFI balance sheet statistics ( published as Guideline ECB / 2001/13 ) to cover certain positions vis-Ã -vis the acceding countries and their currencies as from their accession on 1 May 2004 .
statistics was published as Guideline ECB / 2003/7 in May 2003 . This update will further improve these statistics at the euro area level by providing , among other things , a more detailed geographical and sectoral breakdown of the b.o.p. flows and i.i.p. stocks .
Regarding the institutional framework , in March 2003 the ECB and the European Commission ( Eurostat ) signed an updated Memorandum of Understanding on economic and financial statistics . It sets out the responsibilities of , and cooperation between , the two institutions , without prejudice to the legal provisions laid down in Article 285 of the Treaty and in Article 5 of the Statute of the ESCB .
The ECB continues to have prime responsibility for money and banking statistics , including financial market statistics , whereas the European Commission continues to have prime responsibility for general economic statistics .
Responsibilities for b.o.p. statistics continue to be shared .
The ECB also has prime responsibility for statistics on international reserves , the nominal and real effective exchange rates of the euro , and the quarterly financial accounts for the euro area .
Annual accounts by institutional sector for the Member States remain the prime responsibility of the European Commission , while the development of quarterly non-financial accounts for institutional sectors and the statistical infrastructure , such as seasonal adjustment and data transmission standards , is a shared responsibility .
Moreover , in 2003 a joint Task Force of the ECB and the European Commission ( Eurostat ) identified elements that were most relevant for the quality of b.o.p. statistics and developed quantitative indicators to monitor quality .
These quantitative indicators for the euro area will be incorporated in an overall assessment of quality and published in annual quality reports .
Finally , the ECB and the European Commission ( Eurostat ) have closely cooperated in the preparation of a list of monthly and quarterly Principal European Economic Indicators that should become available for the euro area much sooner than at present , based on more timely contributions from Member States .
5 ECONOMIC RESEARCH The goal of economic research at the ECB is to provide a strong conceptual and empirical basis for policy-making and to better communicate policy to the markets and the public .
High-quality research is essential to ensure that the ECB is well equipped to cope with the unprecedented challenges associated with conducting a single monetary policy for a group of sovereign countries .
The most important task of economic research within the Eurosystem is to increase knowledge of the functioning of the euro area economy and , more specifically , to provide models , tools and analyses relevant to the conduct of monetary policy and the fulfilment of other tasks of the Eurosystem .
An example of this policy orientation is its role in the evaluation of the ECB 's monetary policy strategy , where a number of background studies served as input to the Governing Council 's evaluation ( see Box 1 ) .

5.2 RESEARCH NETWORKS 5.1 RESEARCH TOPICS The research agenda for 2003 can be broken down into six fields : monetary policy strategy , rules and indicators ;
the transmission of monetary policy ;
financial markets and institutions ;
international economics and finance ;
the macroeconomic modelling of the euro area ;
and general economic and structural issues .
Most of the research is first presented in the ECB 's Working Paper series and -- to a more limited extent -- the ECB 's Occasional Paper series , as well as at conferences and workshops , before being published in academic journals or books .
17 Chart 35 shows the growing volume of research produced since 1999 and the high number of papers already or soon to be published in academic journals or books . 18 Chart 36 illustrates the focus on policy-relevant research at the ECB .
It categorises ECB Working Papers by topic , using the Journal of Economic Literature classification types . Â« Macroeconomics and monetary economics Â» is the most common topic in the series , followed by Â« mathematical and quantitative methods Â» , Â« financial Â» and Â« international Â» economics .
They may include economists from the ECB , euro area NCBs , other central banks and policy-making organisations , and academics . The ECB participates and provides coordination and organisational support , alone or with other institutions .
A major project completed in 2003 was the Eurosystem Monetary Transmission Network . Launched in 1999 by the ECB and the euro area 17 For some descriptive statistics on the scope of the research produced at the ECB , see V. Gaspar and J. L. Vega , Â« Research at a policy making institution : launching research at the ECB Â» , Swiss Journal of Economics and Statistics , vol. 138 , issue 4 , 2002 , pp. 359-376 .
18 The ECB Working Paper series comprises research work by ECB staff and visitors .
Papers by researchers not affiliated with the ECB can also be released in the series to the extent that they have been produced in the context of ECB-led research initiatives and / or presented at research conferences / workshops organised by the ECB .

NCBs , it investigated how the single monetary policy affects the euro area economy .
The project collected comprehensive evidence on the transmission mechanism . Participants conducted in-depth studies using both macroeconometric and microeconometric data with a focus on firm investment behaviour and on the role of banks in the transmission process .
It also included a comparison of the transmission mechanism in the euro area and that in the United States .
Several articles in journals and working papers resulted from the project , and a book containing the complete results was published in November 2003 .
19 While the network conducted most of its research using data covering the period before the introduction of the euro , some of the followup evidence was extended in 2003 to cover the period since 1999 .
In 2003 , in order to gain a better understanding of the dynamics of inflation in the euro area and in the component countries , a Eurosystem Inflation Persistence Network was created , bringing together researchers from the ECB and all euro area NCBs .
being used to study the phenomenon , including individual and sectoral data on consumer and producer prices , macroeconomic inflation rates and survey results . The results are expected in 2004 and 2005 .
The Network held two workshops in 2003 , and the ECB hosted the Network 's first conference in December 2003 , on the main sources of exogenous shocks for the G7 economies and the euro area . 20 The International Wage Flexibility Project , sponsored by the ECB together with the Institute for the Study of Labour ( IZA ) in Bonn and organised by the Federal Reserve Bank of 19 I.

New York and the Brookings Institution , provides a discussion forum for researchers from 13 countries studying the extent and nature of wage rigidities using individual data . Special emphasis is placed on the comparability of methodologies and results .
A panel session at the meeting of the American Economic Association was organised in 2003 . The final conference will be held at the ECB in June 2004 .
In 2003 both the ECB and the NCBs were very active in the area of econometric modelling . The modelling framework for the euro area encompasses , for example , traditional macroeconometric and time-series models as well as state-of-the-art dynamic factor , structural vector auto-regressive and stochastic general equilibrium models .
This line of work , and the related cooperation , is now being extended to cover the central banks of the acceding countries .
event organised every two years on a topic of particular relevance to the ECB .
This event targets high-level participants from central banks , international and European institutions , and academic institutions , as well as members of the financial press .
The proceedings of the conference are published .
The second recurring event is the series of conferences of the International Research Forum on Monetary Policy . Co-organised with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System , the Center for Financial Studies at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University ( Frankfurt ) and the Center for German and European Studies at Georgetown University ( Washington D.C. , United States ) , this initiative focuses on research on monetary policy issues that are relevant from a global perspective .
The second conference in the series took place in November 2003 on the premises of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System .
22 Interaction with visitors is an important channel of external communication and collaboration for ECB researchers .
To foster interaction between ECB staff and the international research community , the ECB organises a Research Visitors Programme which enables recognised researchers working on topics of interest to the ECB to spend a limited period of time conducting research while hosted by the Directorate General Research .
Furthermore , in 2003 a number of colleagues from the ACCBs presented their analytical and research work to the ECB .
On a junior level , the ECB continued to offer outstanding students enrolled in postgraduate courses at leading international universities the possibility to conduct part of their research at the ECB ( see Section 2 of Chapter 8 ) .
Finally , external consultants advise on selected issues and external speakers contribute to the ECB 's extensive seminar programme . 23 21 For more information on the projection exercise , see Â« A guide to Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projection exercises Â» , ECB , June 2001 .
23 More information on visitor programmes can be found on the ECB 's website . 5.4 CONFERENCES AND VISITOR PROGRAMMES As part of its broader commitment to a continuous and active exchange with the academic world , the ECB organises or coorganises a number of conferences and workshops related to its core interests .
102 ECB Annual Report 2003
6 O T H E R TA S K S A N D A C T I V I T I E S 6.1 COMPLIANCE WITH THE PROHIBITIONS OF MONETARY FINANCING AND PRIVILEGED ACCESS Pursuant to Article 237 ( d ) of the Treaty , the ECB is entrusted with the task of monitoring the fulfilment by the 15 EU NCBs and the ECB of their obligations under Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty and Council Regulations ( EC ) Nos 3603/93 and 3604/93 .
This task is performed by the General Council of the ECB .
Article 102 prohibits any measure , not based on prudential considerations , which establishes privileged access by governments and Community institutions or bodies to financial institutions .
In parallel with the General Council , the European Commission monitors Member States Â» compliance with the above provisions .
The General Council also monitors the EU central banks Â» secondary market purchases of debt instruments issued by both the domestic public sector and the public sector of other Member States .
According to the recitals of Council Regulation ( EC ) No 3603/93 , the acquisition of public sector debt instruments in the secondary market must not be used to circumvent the objective of Article 101 of the Treaty .
In 2003 the General Council found two cases of non-compliance with the above Treaty requirements and the associated Council Regulations by NCBs of Member States .
In both cases , the amount of coins held by the NCBs and credited to the public sector exceeded the limit of 10 % of coins in circulation , as laid down in Article 6 of Council Regulation ( EC ) No 3603/93 .
In the context of the strong inflows of coins to NCBs prior to the introduction of euro coins on 1 January 2002 , Finland exceeded the limit from October 2001 and France from January 2002 .
In the case of France , the limit continued to be exceeded until April 2003 , while in the case of Finland , the situation was only remedied in December 2003 .
Thus , at the end of 2003 , the situation had been fully corrected in both countries .
6.2 ADVISORY FUNCTIONS Article 105 ( 4 ) of the Treaty and Article 4 of the Statute of the ESCB require that the ECB be consulted by the relevant Community institution and the responsible national authorities , 24 as appropriate , on any proposed Community or national legislation which falls within the ECB 's fields of competence .
The limits and conditions applicable to the consultation of the ECB by national authorities in respect of draft legislation are set out in Council Decision 98/415 / EC of 29 June 1998.25 All ECB opinions are published on the ECB 's website .
26 In total , 32 consultations were initiated in 2003 , 21 by a national authority and 11 by the EU Council . Of these 32 , two concerned means of payment , four statistics and 11 rules which could influence the stability of financial institutions and markets .
Three opinions adopted in accordance with Article 105 ( 4 ) of the Treaty warrant specific mention : one on the proposal for an EU directive on investment services and regulated markets , which is presented in more detail in Section 2 of Chapter 3 , and the other two on the Finnish 24 In accordance with the Protocol on certain provisions relating to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland , as annexed to the Treaty , Article 105 ( 4 ) of the Treaty and Article 4 of the Statute of the ESCB shall not apply to the United Kingdom .
25 Article 2 of this Decision elaborates the specific areas in which the ECB is to be consulted .
26 In 2002 the Governing Council endorsed a disclosure policy entailing that , as a general rule , all ECB opinions issued upon the request of national authorities would be published on the ECB 's website in the languages of adoption ( i.e. both English and the language of the respective consulting authority ) six months after their adoption , unless they were of policy relevance , in which case they would be made publicly available immediately after adoption .
Government 's draft proposals to amend the Suomen Pankki Act .
The proposal to amend the Suomen Pankki Act , on which the ECB delivered its first opinion , 27 suggested limiting Suomen Pankki 's ability to make financial provisions .
It further suggested transferring the whole annual profit of Suomen Pankki to the State unless the Parliamentary Supervisory Council decides otherwise , as well as transferring around Euros 740 million of the capital to the State , which would have forced Suomen Pankki to sell foreign reserve assets .
The ECB objected to the proposal primarily because of the combined effect of the suggested amendments on the financial situation of Suomen Pankki and the lack of any statutory safeguards ensuring the performance of ESCB tasks , which together would undermine the financial independence of Suomen Pankki .
In December 2003 the ECB was consulted on a revised government proposal to amend the Suomen Pankki Act .
In its second opinion , the ECB welcomed the fact that the final legislative proposal submitted to the ECB did not reduce the capital of Suomen Pankki . However , the ECB noted that the requirements for financial independence were not fully satisfied and that the proposal was therefore still incompatible with the Treaty and its intentions .
Following the second opinion , the legislative proposal was withdrawn .
In addition to the opinions adopted in accordance with Article 105 ( 4 ) of the Treaty , the ECB also delivered an opinion pursuant to Article 48 of the Treaty on European Union concerning the draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe , which is presented in more detail in Section 1.1 of Chapter 4 .
The ECB also delivered two opinions pursuant to Article 112 ( 2 ) ( b ) of the Treaty and Article 11.2 of the Statute of the ESCB .
These opinions concerned recommendations from the EU Council on the appointment of the new President of the ECB and a new member of the Executive Board of the ECB .
A list of the opinions adopted in 2003 and early 2004 is included as an annex .
6.3 THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE BORROWING AND LENDING OPERATIONS OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY In accordance with Article 123 ( 2 ) of the Treaty and Article 9 of Council Regulation ( EC ) No 332/2002 of 18 February 2002 , the ECB continues to have responsibility for the administration of the borrowing and lending operations of the European Community under the Medium-Term Financial Assistance mechanism .
During 2003 , however , the ECB performed no administration tasks of this nature , as there was no outstanding balance at the end of 2002 and as no new operations were initiated during 2003 .
6.4 RESERVE MANAGEMENT SERVICES In 2003 the Eurosystem started work on a new framework for the banking services that its members offer to non-EU central banks , monetary authorities , third countries and international institutions for reserve management purposes .
At the core of this framework is a benchmark range of services that will allow customers to manage their eurodenominated reserve assets through any of the euro area central banks that have opted to provide this range of services .
The new framework will offer customers the possibility of using the services concerned under harmonised conditions , irrespective of the Eurosystem central bank they have selected as service provider .
Details of the new framework will be finalised in the first half of 2004 and then implemented in the second half of the year .

FINANCIAL STABILITY AND INTEGRATION
1 F I N A N C I A L S TA B I L I T Y Throughout 2003 financial stability was an important item on the agenda of international and European institutions and fora .
At the international level , the Financial Stability Forum continued to provide an important contribution to identifying sources of vulnerability for the financial system from a global perspective .
At the EU level , following a decision taken by the ECOFIN Council in December 2002 , the Economic and Financial Committee ( EFC ) started to hold regular discussions on financial stability issues relevant for the EU .
Within the Eurosystem , the Governing Council also began holding regular discussions on financial stability conditions in the euro area / EU supported by work carried out by the ECB in collaboration with the ESCB 's Banking Supervision Committee ( BSC ) .
The results of this work are also intended to contribute to international and European discussions on the matter .
Most of the risks to the stability of the European financial system were the legacy of remaining domestic financial imbalances , notably in the corporate sector ( see also Box 2 ) .
Corporations in Europe made efforts to adjust their balance sheets , particularly in those sectors where relatively high indebtedness had been an earlier concern . They embarked upon cost-cutting programmes , scaled back investment and , in some sectors such as telecommunications , restructured their debt .
While these efforts generally paid off in raising profitability , they were not sufficient to bring down debt ratios for the corporate sector as a whole .
There were , however , sectoral differences , with financing conditions improving notably in the telecommunications sector .
As for European households , debt / income ratios rose further in the course of 2003 , mostly reflecting an accumulation of mortgage debt in an environment of historically low interest rates and relatively stable labour market conditions .
The relatively high demand of households for mortgages proved to be important in sustaining the interest income of banks in an otherwise challenging environment .
However , in some countries it also led to relatively rapid increases in residential property prices , which could pose some risk for credit institutions in those countries in the event of a sudden downward movement in house prices . Overall , however , these risks appeared to be rather remote .
The stability of financial markets improved in 2003 .
After three years of almost continuous decline and exceptional volatility , equity markets started to recover in mid-March 2003 and volatility settled down as geopolitical risks receded and confidence in prospects for an economic recovery began to broaden . This provided scope for corporations to issue fresh equity and / or debt , with bond spreads diminishing significantly and bond activity improving .
1.1 FINANCIAL STABILITY MONITORING The monitoring of financial stability developments and conditions conducted by the ECB in collaboration with the BSC is intended to identify potential sources of vulnerability in the financial system of the euro area / EU and to assess its resilience to potential shocks .
While the financial system as a whole ( banks , nonbank financial institutions , financial markets and the financial infrastructure ) is monitored , the focus is on banks , given that they continue to represent the main component of the euro area / EU financial system .
In order to conduct a proper assessment , both cyclical and structural developments must be taken into account .
CYCLICAL DEVELOPMENTS The unwinding of financial imbalances which had accumulated in the EU in the 1990s continued to have an impact on the financial system in 2003 .
However , the system continued to prove its resilience to these imbalances , also reflecting the improved macroeconomic and financial backdrop as 2003 progressed ( discussed in greater detail in Chapter 1 ) .
historical standards .
Low interest rates in early 2003 , however , strained in particular some financial institutions , notably insurance companies and pension funds , through their impact on these institutions Â» liabilities .
These strains were eased by an upturn in long-term interest rates in the second half of the year .
In early 2003 , following three years of profit erosion , EU insurance companies were confronted with significant pressures on their solvency positions that were the result of both the tumble in stock prices since 2000 and the more recent downward pressure on longterm interest rates .
However , the subsequent rebound tended to ease balance sheet strains and some signs of improvement became evident by mid-2003 .
Nonetheless , some solvency and income pressures remained , as well as uncertainties surrounding the extent to which insurance companies had accumulated credit risk through the credit risk transfer market .
The EU banking sector remained resilient , albeit challenged for a third consecutive year by subpar economic growth in 2003 . It absorbed the adverse effects of a less benign than expected environment .
Banks responded well to the challenging environment by cutting costs , reorganising businesses and improving their risk management policies .
Large banks succeeded in maintaining , and even improving , profitability and solvency levels in the first half of 2003 .
Relatively low provisioning for loan losses , cost savings and an upturn in income from financial market-related activities all served to boost profitability in 2003 .
These developments were also reflected in the regulatory solvency ratios of EU banks , which remained favourable .
However , the ratios of some banks benefited from asset sales and from a reduction in risk-weighted assets rather than from either new equity issuance or profit reserving .
In February 2003 the ECB published for the first time a report entitled Â« EU banking sector stability Â» , which was followed by a second report in November of the same year .
The reports summarised the main findings by the BSC of the regular monitoring of the stability of the EU banking sector .
STRUCTURAL DEVELOPMENTS The difficult economic and financial market environment in recent years compelled banks to enhance efficiency , inter alia through cost-cutting and the shedding of non-core activities .
This implied a slowing-down in , or discontinuation of , some of the longerterm trends apparent in earlier years , notably internationalisation , consolidation and disintermediation .
Overall , these responses to difficult business conditions helped banks to withstand ongoing strains and also contributed to improving banking stability over the medium and longer term .
Internationalisation strategies , particularly in investment banking and trading activities , were frequently scaled back , although links to some regions , such as central and eastern Europe , continued to strengthen .
A focus by banks on their Â« home markets Â» was apparent , particularly for retail operations . However , regional crossborder banking activities , regarded as a natural extension of business in the home market , were further expanded .
It seems that competitive pressures in the home market have , to a large extent , driven recent internationalisation activities . Thus recent expansion was mainly aimed at improving profitability by entering markets with higher margins and where there was a clear comparative advantage .
Consolidation in the banking sector continued , albeit at a reduced speed , but competitive pressures in general remained high despite this increasing concentration .
Banks continued to opt for a distribution strategy based on the simultaneous use of branches and remote channels , which could also be seen as part of banks Â» efforts to improve the quality of service to customers . However , branch networks remained at the core of banks Â» distribution strategies .
from the pure processing of transactions towards the provision of advice-intensive , more sophisticated and value-added services .
With regard to intermediation , i.e. the role of banks as intermediaries in channelling funds from depositors to borrowers , banks were faced with reduced corporate demand for funds and capital market issuance .
However , retail activities proved to be a stable source of income .
In particular , banks Â» retail customers tended to shed equity from their portfolios amid a volatile market environment , favouring relatively safe and liquid deposits .
At the same time , household lending remained rather buoyant .
EU banks expanded their range of products and services , particularly to retail customers .
Banks offered a greater number of new saving instruments comprising products that link returns to an index in combination with option features , for example by including a floor on losses .
In some countries , high-risk investment alternatives such as hedge funds have been made available to retail investors through banks .
Hence , consumers are being faced with ever-increasing product complexity . This has induced banks to increase their efforts to enhance investor confidence in securitiesrelated products via organisational changes and improvements in their governance structures .
Finally , banks improved their risk management with a view to better controlling increased credit risk and also in response to the challenge posed by forthcoming changes in capital requirements ( New Basel Capital Accord , or Basel II ; see Section 2 of this chapter ) .
Increasing participation in the credit risk transfer market was one avenue pursued to better manage risks .
Credit risk transfer instruments enable banks to unbundle risks more easily and to shape their credit risk exposure more effectively .
Banks mainly tended to use these instruments to reduce credit risk , although in some cases they were able to achieve better portfolio diversification by assuming additional credit risks . Banks also
stepped up their efforts to increase resilience to operational risks .
A more detailed analysis of the main structural developments in the EU banking sector can be found in the BSC 's report entitled Â« Structural analysis of the EU banking sector Â» published by the ECB in November 2003 .
1.2 COOPERATION IN CRISIS SITUATIONS In early 2003 EU central banks and supervisory authorities agreed on a Memorandum of Understanding ( MoU ) concerning cooperation in crisis situations .
This MoU consists of a set of principles and procedures for cooperation in crisis situations involving individual credit institutions or banking groups , or relating to disturbances in financial markets and / or market infrastructures which could have potential common implications for Member States .
These principles and procedures deal specifically with the identification of the national authorities responsible for crisis management , the required flows of information between all authorities involved and the practical conditions for sharing cross-border information .
In the course of 2003 , a crisis management simulation was carried out with the aim of enhancing understanding of how the provisions of the MoU would assist the organisation of cooperation and information-sharing between authorities in practice .
This exercise provided very useful insights into the different aspects of cross-border cooperation between banking supervisors and NCBs in the event of a financial crisis .
110 ECB Annual Report 2003
2 F I N A N C I A L R E G U L AT I O N A N D S U P E R V I S I O N 2.1 THE LAMFALUSSY FRAMEWORK Following the results of the public consultation on the report by the EFC on Â« EU Arrangements for Financial Regulation , Supervision and Stability Â» , the ECOFIN Council recommended in December 2002 that the new Lamfalussy framework 1 , which was already in place in the securities sector , be extended to all other financial sectors .
The adoption of the new framework is expected to enhance the flexibility and efficiency of the regulatory process , as it distinguishes between primary legislation , adopted by the ECOFIN Council and the European Parliament through the co-decision procedure ( known as level 1 legislation ) , and secondary legislation , which consists of implementing measures that can be adopted more quickly and in a more flexible way .
This will enable the regulatory process to respond more quickly and effectively to technological change and market developments .
This new framework is also designed to meet the need for effective supervisory cooperation and convergence , and is thus expected to contribute to a more consistent implementation of EU rules across Member States .
The Lamfalussy framework relies in particular on the involvement of regulatory committees in the different financial sectors . These committees , which are also known as level 2 committees , are composed of representatives of the Member States nominated by the relevant ministers .
In addition , supervisory committees , also known as level 3 committees , have been mandated to promote the convergence of supervisory practices , to enhance supervisory cooperation ( including the exchange of information on supervised institutions ) and to provide technical advice to the Commission on draft implementing measures .
In November 2003 the Commission adopted a series of measures to implement the Council 's recommendation .
In the banking sector , the existing Banking Advisory Committee ( BAC ) has been transformed into the regulatory European Banking Committee ( EBC ) and a new Committee of European Banking Supervisors ( CEBS ) has been set up .
Close cooperation between the ESCB 's Banking Supervision Committee ( BSC ) and the CEBS will be sought to ensure that there is no overlap in activities .
In the insurance sector , the existing Insurance Committee has been converted into the regulatory European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Committee ( EIOPC ) . A new Committee of European Insurance and Occupational Pension Supervisors ( CEIOPS ) has also been established .
In the area of financial conglomerates , the regulatory Financial Conglomerates Committee ( FCC ) was established in 2003 with no plans to set up a supervisory committee .
The ECB participates as an observer or non-voting member in the regulatory and supervisory committees , with the exception of those in the insurance sector . Thus the ECB is able to contribute to the shaping of EU financial regulation and supervision in accordance with its institutional tasks .
2.2 BANKING In the area of banking regulation , the review of the framework for minimum capital requirements and the preparation of the New Basel Capital Accord continued throughout 2003 .
The ECB , which participates as an observer in the relevant committees , continued to contribute to the shaping of the new framework .
At the international level , the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ( BCBS ) made substantial progress in several areas .
First , it finalised and published in May 2003 the results of the third quantitative impact study ( known as the Â« QIS3 ") aimed at gauging the overall impact of the new rules on banks Â» minimum capital requirements .
The study involved banks across 43 countries and thus went well beyond those countries represented in the BCBS . Its main 1 Â« Final Report of the Committee of Wise Men on the Regulation of European Securities Markets Â» , 15 February 2001 .
This report is available on the European Commission 's website . ECB Annual Report 2003
111 findings were encouraging as they were consistent with the BCBS 's objectives to increase the risk sensitivity of capital requirements while keeping the overall amount of current capital requirements broadly unchanged .
Second , the BCBS conducted two public consultations .
The Â« third consultative paper Â» was released in April 2003 and comments were published in August .
The public consultation confirmed the broad support for the structure of the new Accord and the need to adopt a more risk-sensitive framework .
Another public consultation was launched in October on proposed amendments that would change the treatment of expected versus unexpected losses under the new Accord 's internal ratings-based approach .
In addition , the BCBS identified scope for further improvement in the areas of asset securitisation , credit card commitments and certain credit risk mitigation techniques , on which work continues .
The third area in which the BCBS made substantial progress was the analysis of issues concerning the implementation of the new Accord , which will also be reflected in national legislation .
These issues were increasingly taken into consideration by the BCBS through the work of the Accord Implementation Group .
The BCBS also released a paper specifying high-level principles for the cross-border implementation of the new capital requirements .
In its response to the third consultative paper published on its website in September 2003 , the ECB reiterated its overall support for the Basel reform and acknowledged the progress achieved .
In addition to its input on several technical issues , the ECB focused on issues warranting particular attention for both finalisation of the new Accord and implementation of the new rules , as well as on future priorities .
The ECB welcomed the proposals to tackle the potential pro-cyclical effects and pointed out that some improvements could still be made by strengthening the incentives for banks to opt for more advanced risk management policies . Special emphasis was given to the importance of the timely
completion and implementation of the new Accord . From a more forward-looking perspective , the ECB underlined the need for close monitoring of the new regime in order to develop a full understanding of all its possible implications .
The ECB also stressed the need to prioritise work on accounting and provisioning , as well as on the definition of own funds and on the convergence of supervisory practices .
At the EU level , the reform of the regulatory capital framework conducted within the remit of the Financial Services Action Plan ( FSAP , see Section 3 of this chapter ) continued to follow the Basel reform process closely , while at the same time taking European particularities into account .
In July 2003 the European Commission released a third working document for public consultation together with an analysis of the EU results of the third quantitative impact study .
Significant features of the EU context include the scope of application of the new rules , the nature of the EU framework , the treatment of small and medium-sized enterprises and the suitability of the framework for small and less complex banks .
Like the BCBS conclusions , the findings of the European Commission on the quantitative impact study , released in parallel with the third consultative proposals , were supportive of the reform 's main objectives .
In addition , in April 2003 the European Commission released two documents for consultation , one on real estate lending and one on the treatment of covered bonds , and it subsequently published the comments received on these two topics .
The ECB provided comments on the European Commission 's proposals for the revision of the capital framework of banks and investment firms .
The ECB supported the work being undertaken at the EU level and highlighted the importance of maintaining consistency between the New Basel Capital Accord and the revised EU framework and ensuring that they were completed and implemented at the same time .
ECB Annual Report 2003 2.3 SECURITIES In 2003 good progress was made on several initiatives to fill the gaps in the European securities markets legislation and to update existing rules .
The ECB contributed to the shaping of the relevant rules in the context of both the preparatory discussions in the appropriate EU committees and formal consultations .
Within the context of the FSAP , two directives were adopted and a further two came closer to completion .
In January 2003 the Market Abuse Directive was adopted , providing for harmonised rules on the prevention of insider dealing and market manipulation , and in July 2003 the Prospectus Directive was introduced , providing for a single passport for European securities issuers .
In March 2003 the European Commission set out in its draft transparency directive disclosure requirements for European issuers listed on regulated markets .
A common position was adopted in December by the ECOFIN Council with regard to the proposal for a new directive on markets in financial instruments , which would replace the existing Investment Service Directive dating back to 1993 .
In its opinion on this proposed new directive , the ECB welcomed the principles underlying the revised regulatory framework .
An effective implementation of the proposed directive clearly has the potential to foster the integration of European securities markets .
More specifically , as regards the new regulatory framework on trade execution , the ECB welcomed the proposed strengthening of transparency rules as a tool to avoid market fragmentation and to allow investors to choose the most efficient trading venues .
However , the ECB emphasised that the new transparency rules should be applied to debt securities as well as to shares , and that the means for a full comparison of all market prices should be provided for .
2.4 OTHER ISSUES The EU accounting framework has been at the centre of debate owing to the legal requirement that all listed European companies , including banks , prepare their consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Accounting Standards ( IAS ) by 2005 .
The ECB has a keen interest in this debate as the accounting reforms will have a profound impact on the banking and financial industry .
Furthermore , harmonised and high quality standards will provide a significant contribution to the integration and efficiency of financial markets in the euro area .
The ECB 's interest also stems from concerns that the wider use of fair value for financial instruments , mentioned in the IAS proposals , might have significant effects on financial stability .
The Governing Council , particularly in the light of analyses conducted in this area since 2001 , has reiterated in letters to the IAS Board and the European Commission its concerns about the potential implications for financial stability of the introduction of fair value accounting for all financial instruments , particularly in relation to the completion of IAS 39 , which deals with the recognition and measurement of financial instruments .
Finally , given the increasing number of reforms being made to national supervisory structures , the ECB published a report entitled Â« Developments in national supervisory structures Â» in June 2003 in order to provide a Â« snapshot Â» of the main changes which had recently occurred in this area , together with the resulting institutional settings within the EU and the acceding countries .
3 F I N A N C I A L I N T E G R AT I O N The ESCB is committed to the integration of European financial markets and market infrastructures because of their key role in the transmission of monetary policy and in financial stability , and because their integration should help to create a level playing-field for all agents regardless of their location within the EU .
In addition , Article 105 of the Treaty states that without prejudice to the objective of price stability , the ESCB shall support the general economic policies in the Community , among which financial integration occupies a prominent position .
This support takes the form of direct action , catalysis of collective action and contributions towards raising the level of awareness of the need for integration and the means for achieving it .
In 2003 the ECB intensified its activities to help to achieve a broad-based integration of Europe 's financial system , both by means of its own activities and by contributing to the work of other European bodies within various committees and fora .
THE ECB' S CONTRIBUTION TO THE EU STRATEGY FOR FINANCIAL SERVICES The current framework for achieving a more integrated and efficient financial system in the EU is based on the 1999 Financial Services Action Plan ( FSAP ) and on a regulatory process inspired by the 2001 Lamfalussy Report .
The first high-level assessment of this framework is expected to take place in the summer of 2004 .
As agreed by the Heads of State or Government at the Brussels European Council in March 2003 , most legislative measures initially considered in the FSAP will have been adopted by April 2004 .
The European Parliament will then go into recess and further legislative work will be suspended .
Work is still under way on several important initiatives .
The Lamfalussy process is now being extended to other financial sectors ( see Section 2.1 of this chapter ) . Full and successful implementation of the Lamfalussy process should provide the European financial system with a faster and more efficient regulatory structure than is currently the case .
While fundamental progress has been made in recent years , there is still a considerable amount of work to be done to further integrate Europe 's financial system .
New EU initiatives have recently been launched to define the Â« postFSAP Â» strategy , which will require the close cooperation of all those involved .
The ECB has been closely involved in this work and has provided its views in the form of ECB opinions , for example on the proposal for the new directive on markets in financial instruments ( see also Section 2.3 of this chapter ) , and in the different fora where the various issues are discussed .
In particular , the ECB considers that the measures of the FSAP provide the core legislative framework for the single market in financial services .
The potential for further financial integration within this framework offers opportunities and poses challenges to public authorities as well as market participants .
The ECB is of the opinion that it is important for public authorities to implement the FSAP measures in a coherent manner across Member States .
The extension of the Lamfalussy process will allow for more uniform technical rules in this respect .
This should contribute to the establishment of a common regulatory framework for market players which may also be quickly adjusted if needed .
Furthermore , as integration proceeds , the transmission channels for systemic risk are likely to change , which justifies increased cooperation and information exchange between supervisors and central banks in order to promote a robust supervisory and financial stability framework .
To complement public sector initiatives , market participants also need to enhance their contribution to EU financial integration through collective action in two main areas .
First , they need to participate effectively in the policymaking process in the context of enhanced consultation procedures at the EU level . 114
ECB Annual Report 2003 Second , collective action by market participants , possibly with the support of public authorities , is equally warranted in the area of market conventions and product standardisation .
THE ECB' S ROLE IN FOSTERING COORDINATION AMONG MARKET PARTICIPANTS Beyond its cooperation with other public authorities , the ECB also acts in collaboration with the private sector in order to foster collective action .
The Short-Term European Paper ( STEP ) initiative and the activities of the European Financial Markets Lawyers Group ( EFMLG ) are two examples of the ECB 's involvement in private sector initiatives .
The ECB welcomes and encourages the STEP initiative , which is currently being carried out by a group of market participants under the auspices of the ACI , the Financial Markets Association .
This initiative aims to integrate the fragmented European markets for short-term debt instruments and to promote their development .
The ECB was requested to play the role of facilitator in this initiative , a role similar to that played when it established the EONIA .
In particular , the ECB has already hosted , at the request and on behalf of private sector participants , a public consultation on means of further integrating this particular market segment .
STEP undertakes to create a de facto integrated wholesale market for short-term debt instruments through the convergence of existing European markets .
The aim is to help market practices to converge under the existing European and national legislative frameworks by means of market convention . This initiative would rely on the voluntary participation of issuers prepared to meet certain conditions specified in the market convention in order to have their issuance programmes granted a STEP label .
The above-mentioned conditions would not substitute or change existing national regulations , but would be supplementary to those already in existence .
Credit institutions , other financial intermediaries ( including issuers of asset-backed securities ) , corporations and public authorities would all be entitled to apply for the STEP label for their issuance programmes .
The EFMLG was established in 1999 and aims to discuss and promote initiatives leading to greater harmonisation of European financial market activities ( laws and market practices ) following the introduction of the euro . The EFMLG is composed of senior lawyers from credit institutions based in the EU and selected on the basis of their personal expertise .
Recently , the EFMLG provided support and assistance to the ACI with regard to the legal aspects of the STEP initiative .
The group has also focused on the removal of legal barriers to the cross-border use of collateral , the legal aspects of netting arrangements in the EU , the harmonisation of the legal framework for rights in securities evidenced by book entries and the dematerialisation of securities , i.e. the process of issuing a security under an electronic scheme rather than issuing physical certificates .
2 SINGLE EURO PAYMENTS AREA In 2002 the Eurosystem agreed on a cooperation model with the European Payments Council ( EPC ) , i.e. the governance structure of the European banking sector set up with the aim of creating a Single Euro Payments Area ( SEPA ) in which differences between the levels of service for national and cross-border retail payments are to be eliminated by 2010 .
The ECB participated as an observer in the EPC plenary , which is the decision-making body of the EPC , and the EPC working groups for cash , cards , straight-through processing ( STP ) and infrastructure .
The Eurosystem formally assessed the banking sector 's achievements in terms of the SEPA in a progress report entitled Â« Towards a Single Euro Payments Area Â» published in June 2003 . In this report , the Eurosystem expressed strong support for the 2 For further details on the EFMLG see www.efmlg.org .
One milestone was the launch of STEP 2 in April 2003 by the Euro Banking Association , a cooperative undertaking between EU-based commercial banks and EU branches of non-EU banks . STEP 2 is a new retail crossborder system for the processing of bulk payments ( currently only credit transfers ) .
It is the first service provider for a pan-European automated clearing house ( PE-ACH ) .
STEP 2 's receiver capability -- which is a bank 's capability to receive a payment through the PE-ACH -- was gradually extended to all EU banks , thereby increasing its market share of intra-EU credit transfers .
However , the progress report also made it clear that should banks backtrack on their promised deliverables to achieve a SEPA , the Eurosystem would consider regulatory measures in addition to its catalyst role .
The Eurosystem specifically stressed the importance of implementing panEuropean standards for STP as a prerequisite for accomplishing a SEPA for all payment instruments .
In the progress report , the Eurosystem listed specific indicators ( known as Â« SEPA indicators ") for measuring progress made towards a SEPA against the EPC 's own objectives and milestones .
In the second half of 2003 , the EPC and the Eurosystem agreed on a reporting framework for these SEPA indicators , including quarterly reports by the EPC to the Eurosystem .
The first report , delivered at the end of 2003 , showed progress in different areas , such as the implementation of International Bank Account Numbers ( IBAN ) and the introduction of a basic credit transfer service ( Credeuro ) with a guaranteed speed of execution of three days .
In October 2003 the ECB , in cooperation with the EPC , arranged a workshop on the SEPA targeted specifically at involving acceding countries in the SEPA process .
Moreover , meetings were held in the course of the year with EU market participants in the Contact Group for Euro Payments Strategy ( COGEPS ) on the subject of large-value payments issues , as well as retail issues .
Throughout 2003 the Eurosystem also continued to cooperate closely with the European Commission in view of the complementary roles played by the two institutions in terms of facilitating the SEPA .
In this respect , the ECB responded to the public consultation launched by the European Commission on a Â« New Legal Framework for Payments in the Internal Market Â» .
CONSOLIDATION OF THE EUROPEAN SECURITIES INFRASTRUCTURE The Eurosystem has a keen interest in the integration of the securities infrastructure at the EU level in order to ensure a level playing-field across national boundaries .
The process of consolidation of the EU securities clearing and settlement industry continued in 2003 with the merger between two major central counterparty clearing houses , Clearnet and the London Clearing House .
STATISTICAL DATA ON THE DEGREE OF FINANCIAL INTEGRATION IN THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM OF THE EURO AREA In 2003 further statistical data were provided to assess the level of financial integration in the euro area 's financial system .
Box 9 describes some of the measures used to assess the level of integration achieved in financial markets in the euro area .
Box 9 MEASURES OF FINANCIAL MARKET INTEGRATION IN THE EURO AREA Several quantitative measures can be used to measure the level of integration in euro area financial markets .
This box briefly describes some of these measures and assesses the level of integration observed in different financial markets of the euro area .
1 Measures of financial integration make it possible to assess the extent to which geographical considerations affect the price of financial instruments and the behaviour of market participants .
Some of these measures are based on the law of one price . They test whether assets which are comparable and available in all euro area countries trade at the same price throughout the euro area .
Other measures estimate the relative importance of factors common to the euro area in the pricing of assets as opposed to idiosyncratic factors ( notably country-related factors ) .
Finally , some measures are used to quantify the effects of frictions on cross-border investment .
In general , most measures show that the degree of integration in the various financial markets is still heterogeneous . While integration is quite advanced in many segments of the money market , it is less advanced in the bond and equity markets .
Yields on government bonds with similar , or in some cases identical , credit risk , maturity and issuing characteristics have not yet entirely converged .
Differences in primary and secondary market liquidity or in the degree of development of derivatives markets connected to the various individual bond markets may partly account for this .
In the equity markets , the level of integration is not particularly high , although equity returns appear to be increasingly determined by factors common to the euro area .
At the same time , the home bias in equity holdings ( i.e. the fact that investors seem to allocate a disproportionately large fraction of their equity holdings to domestic stocks ) has decreased considerably over the past few years .
However , there are still a number of significant barriers to further integration in the equity markets . Examples include cross-country regulatory differences and the considerable fragmentation of the euro area 's clearing and settlement systems .
In credit markets , there remains significant market fragmentation .
For example , there are persistent home biases in lending to and borrowing from non-financial corporations and households .
Some of these home biases are Â« natural Â» , that is , explained by proximity advantage and information asymmetries ;
others are mainly due to regulatory obstacles , such as tax regulations , bankruptcy law , etc. 1 For further details of these measures , see the article entitled Â« The integration of Europe 's financial markets Â» in the October 2003 issue of the ECB 's Monthly Bulletin .
Box 10
RESEARCH NETWORK ON CAPITAL MARKETS AND FINANCIAL INTEGRATION IN EUROPE In April 2002 the ECB and the Center for Financial Studies ( CFS ) launched a Research Network to promote research on capital markets and financial integration in Europe .
This Network aims to stimulate and coordinate policy-relevant research by academic scholars and researchers from policy institutions , contributing significantly to the ECB 's understanding of the current and future structure and integration of the financial system in Europe and its links to the financial systems of the United States and Japan .
Further information can be found on the Network 's website ( www.eu-financial-system.org ) .
The Network 's first workshop was held at the ECB in April 2002 and concentrated on agenda-setting , identifying five topics of priority for research : ( i ) bank competition and the geographical scope of banking activities , ( ii ) international portfolio choices and asset market links between Europe , the United States and Japan , ( iii ) European bond markets , ( iv ) European securities settlement systems ( SSSs ) and ( v ) the emergence and development of start-up financing and new markets in Europe .
In March 2003 the second workshop , hosted by Suomen Pankki -- Finlands Bank in Helsinki , addressed the first two of these topics .
In November 2003 the third workshop , hosted by the Bank of Greece in Athens , focused on the third topic , as well as discussing the fourth and fifth topics .
1 Within the context of this Network , the ECB also established the Â« Lamfalussy Fellowship Â» programme , named after the first President of the EMI .
This programme sponsors young researchers to conduct valuable research on the above-mentioned topics .
Two years of work on the Network will be concluded with a symposium at the ECB in Frankfurt in May 2004 , presenting the most important results found .
Some of these results reveal first of all that some of the inherent characteristics of traditional loan and deposit business constrain the cross-border expansion of commercial banking , even in a common currency area .
Second , some theoretical research suggests that supervisory structures may not be neutral towards further European banking integration .
Third , there is increasing evidence that the introduction of the euro has contributed to a reduction in the cost of capital in the euro area .
Fourth , too strong a vertical integration between trading and securities settlement platforms can be an obstacle to the efficient consolidation of SSSs .
Finally , the growing globalisation of firms Â» activities is one factor behind the increasing correlation of equity returns observed around the world .
1 In October 2002 the ECB also held its Second Central Banking Conference .
The proceedings are available on the ECB 's website , see V. Gaspar , P. Hartmann , O. Sleijpen ( eds ) , The transformation of the European financial system , June 2003 .
With regard to the euro area banking system , the ECB is developing a set of key indicators to measure the degree of integration in the system .
These indicators are constructed on the basis of quarterly stock data provided by MFIs .
They provide direct measures of cross-border banking business within the euro area .
In addition to traditional measures of the share of cross-border activity , these indicators also focus on the distribution of activity , the role played by national banking systems as the hub and the disparities between national banking systems in terms of access .
Indicators show that the share of cross-border activity is modest for the retail segments of the banking business ( see Box 9 ) , while it is more important and growing in the interbank market for deposits .
It is worth noting , however , that when conducting these cross-border activities , banks are becoming increasingly neutral as regards the geographical location of counterparties within the euro area for retail and wholesale segments alike .
ECB Annual Report 2003 New harmonised MFI interest rate statistics published for the first time in December 2003 allow for a comparison of retail bank interest rates on deposits and loans across the euro area on a harmonised basis ( see Section 4 of Chapter 2 ) .
These new monthly statistics contribute to the assessment of the convergence towards a single European financial market for deposits and loans and will increase the transparency of banking business in the euro area .
Financial market statistics produced by the ECB also include price and volume indicators for the money , bond and equity markets as well as volatility and convergence measures across all euro area market segments .
4 OVERSIGHT OF MARKET INFRASTRUCTURE One of the statutory roles of the Eurosystem is to exercise oversight over payment and clearing systems .
This function aims to ensure that the general organisation of the payment flows within the economy is efficient and safe . In particular , systemic risks arising either from the malfunctioning of payment and clearing systems or from the contagion effects of a failure of a participant in the system should be minimised .
Furthermore , the Eurosystem takes a general interest in other infrastructures which are used for the transfer of securities , such as securities clearing and settlement systems , because failures during the settlement of collateral could jeopardise the implementation of monetary policy and the smooth functioning of payment systems .
Disruptions in securities settlement systems ( SSSs ) can spread to payment systems owing to the existence of delivery versus payment ( DVP ) mechanisms for the transfer of securities and cash payments .
Similarly , central counterparties Â» inability to clear transactions can hinder the settlement of securities transactions .
In view of this general interest , the ECB met with the European Central Securities Depositories Association in 2003 to discuss recent developments affecting settlement service providers .
Furthermore , the Eurosystem discussed its collateral framework , which was subject to a public consultation in 2003 , as well as developments concerning short-term securities , relayed links 3 and securities transactions with market participants at the Contact Group on Euro Securities Infrastructures .
Detailed information on the market infrastructure is given in the ECB 's publication entitled Â« Payment and securities settlement systems in the European Union Â» , also known as the Â« Blue Book Â» .
4 The Eurosystem 's oversight function extends from systems for the exchange of very large payments (" large-value payment systems ") and the network providers on which those systems rely to retail payment services as well as to other activities that could affect the smooth functioning of payments in the euro area .
4.1 OVERSIGHT OF LARGE-VALUE EURO PAYMENT SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE THE TARGET SYSTEM The oversight role of the Eurosystem comprises all euro payment systems including those managed by the Eurosystem itself , e.g. the TransEuropean Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer ( TARGET ) system . With regard to the latter , the minimum oversight standards applied are as strict as those applied to privately operated payment systems .
First , overseers of TARGET ( i.e. the NCBs for the domestic components , the ECB for the EPM ) are to review the various aspects of the TARGET system and assess its compliance with the Â« Core Principles for Systemically Important Payment Systems Â» 5 adopted by the Governing Council in 2001 as the basis for its oversight policy on systemically important payment systems . Second , overseers are to inform those responsible at the NCBs and the Governing Council of the results of this assessment so that , if necessary , measures are considered and implemented to ensure full compliance with the Core Principles .
6 The overall outcome of this 3 With a relayed link SSSs no longer have to establish a link with all other SSSs , but can limit themselves to one link with an intermediate SSS that is connected to many other SSSs . In September 2003 the ECB published an addendum to the Blue Book with data on all 15 EU Member States from 1997 to 2001 .
This publication was prepared in cooperation with the NCBs .
In addition , a two-day seminar for central bankers entitled Â« Payment and securities settlement systems Â» was held at the ECB in the same month .
Report by the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems entitled Â« Core Principles for Systemically Important Payment Systems Â» , BIS , January 2001 .
This report also includes an outline of the responsibilities of the central banks in this respect . Responsibility B states that central banks should ensure that any systemically important payment system they operate complies with the Core Principles .
As part of the same assessment , overseers also evaluated the other euro large-value payment systems , namely the French Paris Net Settlement ( PNS ) , the Finnish Pankkien On-line Pikasiirrot ja Sekit-jÃ¤rjestelmÃ¤ ( POPS ) system , and the Spanish Servicio de Pagos Interbancarios ( SPI ) against the Core Principles . 4
assessment was positive , although issues for further improvement were identified .
The results of this assessment will be made public .
EURO 1 The Euro Banking Association ( EBA ) is a cooperative undertaking between EU-based commercial banks and EU branches of non-EU banks . The EBA created a multilateral largevalue EU-wide payment system for euro credit transfers , called EURO 1 .
In April 2003 the EBA established a new retail cross-border system , known as Â« STEP 2 Â» ( see also Section 3 of this chapter ) .
STEP 2 settles in EURO 1 , making it necessary to implement some technical changes to the latter .
In November 2003 the EBA also introduced a new function called the Â« Flexible Settlement Mechanism Â» allowing banks to settle their STEP 2 positions in EURO 1 without becoming direct members / shareholders of EURO 1 .
As overseer of EURO 1 , the ECB evaluated the changes to the system in respect of its compliance with the Core Principles . The ECB found only minor issues for concern , which did not have any significant impact on the safety and efficiency of EURO 1 .
The ECB will address these findings in cooperation with the EBA in due course . CONTINUOUS LINKED SETTLEMENT SYSTEM The Continuous Linked Settlement ( CLS ) is a system designed to settle foreign exchange transactions on a simultaneous , final and irrevocable basis .
Prior to the introduction of the CLS , each side of a trade was paid separately . The systemic risk in the event of default was high considering the time interval which typically elapsed between the settlement of the two sides of the trade .
The CLS was established as a market response to the pressure exercised by central banks to reduce foreign exchange settlement risk ( known as Â« Herstatt risk ") . 7 The ECB performs a dual role with regard to the CLS .
It is involved in the oversight of the system and it provides settlement services .
Oversight of the CLS is carried out by means of close collaboration between the G10 central banks and the Federal Reserve System as the lead overseer .
In September 2002 the CLS began settling foreign exchange transactions in seven major currencies on a payment versus payment ( PVP ) basis .
8 In September 2003 four additional currencies were added to the list of eligible currencies . 9 Following the start of live operations , banks quickly increased the values and volumes settled through the system .
In December 2003 the CLS settled , on average , 37,000 trades per day to the value of USD 550 billion .
After the US dollar , the euro is the second most important currency settled in this system , accounting for about one-quarter of all gross payments settled in the system .
Thanks to the PVP mechanism , the CLS strongly reduces foreign exchange settlement risk . The Eurosystem welcomes this riskreducing factor .
At the same time , however , the CLS introduces a certain degree of liquidity risk , as banks are required to make substantial payments into the CLS at a specific time of the day ( between 7 a.m. and 12 noon C.E.T. ) and , in the event of a malfunctioning of the system , may not receive corresponding currencies as expected .
Banks have thus far handled these liquidity requirements well .
Their liquidity management procedures seem to be well developed , such that the liquidity demand necessary to make CLS pay-ins has not had a negative impact on the overall market .
The ECB cooperates with the other G10 central banks with regard to oversight and , more specif ically , systemically important settlement infrastructures , the smooth functioning of which is of vital importance beyond the euro area .
8 These currencies are the US dollar , the euro , the Japanese yen , the pound sterling , the Swiss franc , the Canadian dollar and the Australian dollar .
9 These currencies are the Danish krone , the Swedish krona , the Norwegian krone and the Singapore dollar .
10 Average funding requirements fall in the range of several hundred millions of euro . The largest pay-ins account for , on average , around Euros 1 billion , while the largest pay-in by any single bank thus far amounted to Euros 5.9 billion .
None of these payins resulted in a negative impact on the euro money markets . ECB Annual Report 2003
121 SWIFT The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication ( SWIFT ) is a cooperative organisation created and owned by banks which operates a network to facilitate the exchange of payment and other financial messages between financial institutions throughout the entire world .
The ECB contributes to the oversight of SWIFT , which is carried out by means of cooperation between the G10 central banks and the Nationale Bank van BelgiÃ« / Banque Nationale de Belgique as the lead overseer .
In addition to SWIFT 's resilience to crises , much oversight attention was paid to the changeover to a new network generation ( the SWIFTNet migration ) , completion of which is scheduled by the end of 2004 .
SWIFT has kept the overseers regularly informed of the status of the network roll-out , of any incidents or of any envisaged changes to the SWIFTNet migration plan .
CORRESPONDENT BANKING Banks often have arrangements to provide payments and related services to each other primarily for payments across national borders . Such arrangements are referred to as correspondent banking .
In the EU , euro correspondent banking is a highly concentrated activity among a few players .
A recent survey conducted by the ECB among a sample of banks in the EU showed that the top 10 % of reporting banks accounted for almost 80 % of the value ( 34 % of the volume ) of the reported correspondent banking payments in euro .
There are even some indications of further concentration of the correspondent banking business .
At this stage , the Eurosystem does not see any immediate systemic risk in this high degree of concentration , as the share of correspondent banking constitutes only a fraction of the overall payment flows in euro .
The large majority of the payment flows are executed via interbank funds transfer systems ( e.g. TARGET ) .
However , in view of the Eurosystem 's interest in the stability of the financial system as a whole , it will continue to monitor developments in this particular area of business .
4.2 RETAIL PAYMENT SERVICES OVERSIGHT OF RETAIL PAYMENT SYSTEMS In order to carry out its statutory task of promoting the smooth operation of payment systems , the Eurosystem also refined its policy stance on retail payment systems .
Following a public consultation initiated in 2002 , the Governing Council adopted Â« Oversight standards for euro retail payment systems Â» on 26 June 2003 , which can be found together with the accompanying press release on the ECB 's website .
These retail standards are based on the Core Principles for Systemically Important Payment Systems . The adoption of standards in the field of retail payment systems is aimed at fostering safety and efficiency in this sector as well as at ensuring the harmonised oversight of retail payment systems in the euro area .
The retail standards provide indicators for categorising retail payment systems as systemically important retail payment systems , retail systems of prominent importance and other retail payment systems .
All Core Principles will be applied to systemically important retail payment systems , whereas only a selection of six Core Principles will be applied to systems of prominent importance .
Other retail payment systems will have to comply with other applicable standards ( e.g. Eurosystem standards for e-money schemes 11 or standards adopted at the national level ) .
E-MONEY SYSTEMS A common oversight approach by the Eurosystem with regard to e-money was described in its report entitled Â« Electronic money system security objectives Â» in May 11 Â« Report on electronic money Â» , August 1998 ; Â« Electronic money system security objectives Â» , May 2003 .
These security objectives should ensure the overall reliability and technical safety of the schemes and should also increase public confidence in these systems . These objectives were also designed with a view to achieving a level playing-field for the different schemes from a regulatory point of view .
All relevant e-money schemes will be assessed against these standards by the NCBs in the course of 2004 .
E-PAYMENTS In recent years , the increasing use of new communications technologies and the need for specific payment mechanisms for e-commerce have created opportunities for new intermediaries to facilitate the sending and processing of payment instructions .
At the same time , banks have also developed new means for customers to access their accounts and to originate payments .
12 The ECB aims to provide a forum for cooperation between stakeholders and to offer analyses and statistics to support the work of the markets in further developing more efficient and secure payment mechanisms .
Its oversight activities vis-Ã -vis the provision of payments via the internet and mobile networks will initially focus on the security of the corresponding instruments and systems .
In order to achieve these objectives , in May 2003 the ECB relaunched the electronic Payment Systems Observatory ( ePSO ) . The ePSO project was initially launched in 2000 under the auspices of the European Commission .
It consists of a website used for sharing information on innovative electronic payment systems and instruments ( www.e-pso.info ) and contains an electronic discussion forum , an inventory of e-payment schemes and articles on topical subjects of interest .
in January 1998 with a view to mitigating the risks to the Eurosystem when it conducts its monetary policy operations . Second , the Eurosystem cooperates with other authorities responsible for the regulation and oversight of securities clearing and settlement systems at the EU level .
Contributions to the Giovannini Group , a forum of financial experts which advises the European Commission on financial sector issues , were made and included in the second Giovannini Report 14 . As regards international cooperation , the ECB also took part in projects initiated by the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems ( CPSS ) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions ( IOSCO ) with a view to developing recommendations for central counterparties .
Finally , the ECB contributed to the CPSS Â« Report on the role of central bank money in payment systems Â» 15 . ASSESSMENT OF SECURITIES SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS The Eurosystem assesses EU SSSs eligible for the settlement of its credit operations on an annual basis .
The criteria used for these assessments can be found in the report entitled Â« Standards for the use of EU securities settlement systems in ESCB credit operations Â» , which was endorsed by the EMI in November 1997 and comprises nine standards .
As part of the exercise carried out in 2003 , 22 SSSs were assessed ( including four systems located in the three EU countries which have not 12 For further details see the article entitled Â« Electronification of payments in Europe Â» in the May 2003 issue of the ECB 's Monthly Bulletin .
13 In the absence of EU harmonised oversight standards , the user standards have been regarded as de facto common standards for EU SSSs and , therefore , are dealt with in this chapter .
Nevertheless , the user standards are not intended to be a comprehensive set of standards for the oversight or supervision of SSSs .

4.3 SECURITIES CLEARING AND SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS The Eurosystem has thus far played two roles in the field of securities clearing and settlement systems .
First , the Governing Council assesses the compliance of EU SSSs with specific user standards .
13 These standards were established ECB Annual Report 2003
123 yet joined the euro ) .
By and large , those SSSs which were assessed complied with the standards . However , in some cases improvements are still necessary to achieve full compliance .
The Eurosystem acknowledges and is monitoring the efforts being made by the system operators to enhance compliance with the standards .
For example , efforts have been made to increase operational reliability with a special focus on business continuity in the event of a disaster .
Some systems have increased the number of contingency sites and enhanced back-up facilities .
Furthermore , in some countries amendments have been made to the legal framework to enhance the legal soundness of their systems .
Finally , efforts to reduce the unwinding risk that can arise when transactions are settled on a net basis have also been made .
COOPERATION WITH THE COMMITTEE OF EUROPEAN SECURITIES REGULATORS In 2001 the Governing Council approved a framework for cooperation on securities clearing and settlement systems between the ESCB and the Committee of European Securities Regulators ( CESR ) .
In particular , a working group was set up , composed of a representative from each central bank of the ESCB and from each securities regulator from the CESR .
The work of the group focused mainly on developing European standards for clearing and settlement , based on the recommendations of the CPSS and the IOSCO ( referred to as Â« CPSS-IOSCO ") .
When developing these standards , the working group also took into account the need to remove the barriers to efficient cross-border clearing and settlement processes in the EU , as identified in the abovementioned Giovannini Group reports .
In 2003 the working group finalised a consultative report consisting of a set of 19 standards aimed at increasing the safety , soundness and efficiency of securities clearing and settlement systems in the EU .
A public consultation on these standards was conducted jointly by the ESCB and the CESR .
In its report , the working group sought to adopt a functional approach , i.e. to apply the standards to all relevant functions related to the securities clearing and settlement business , without regard to the legal status of the institutions exercising these functions .
Thus the future ESCB-CESR standards will apply to securities market infrastructures and , in particular , to central counterparties and national and international central securities depositories .
It is envisaged that some standards will also apply to major custodian banks (" systemically important custodians ") which are very active in the field of clearing and settlement .
Since preventing distortion is important when identifying Â« systemically important Â» entities , the public consultation included a specific questionnaire on the appropriateness of including custodians and on how to identify major custodians .
The results of the public consultation have been published on the websites of the ECB and the CESR .
The report on the ESCB-CESR standards is expected to be finalised by mid-2004 .

EUROPEAN AND INTERNATIONAL ISSUES
1 EUROPEAN ISSUES In 2003 the ECB continued to maintain its regular contacts with Community institutions and bodies .
ECB representatives attended meetings of the ECOFIN Council when matters relating to the tasks and objectives of the ESCB were discussed .
The President of the ECOFIN Council and the relevant Commissioner also made use of their right to participate in meetings of the Governing Council when they deemed it appropriate .
The President of the ECB and the governors of the NCBs participated in two informal meetings of the ECOFIN Council , which took place in Athens ( Greece ) and Stresa ( Italy ) in April and September respectively .
The President of the ECB also participated regularly in meetings of the Eurogroup , which has continued to serve as a particularly important forum for an open and informal policy dialogue between the ECB , the finance ministers of the euro area countries and the Commission .
Moreover , the ECB continued to attend the biannual meetings of the Macroeconomic Dialogue , which brings together representatives of the Member States , the Commission , the ECB , the non-euro area central banks and the EU-level social partners .
In addition to these relations at the political level , the ECB continued to participate in meetings of various European bodies at senior expert and working levels , including , most notably , the Economic and Financial Committee ( EFC ) , the Economic Policy Committee ( EPC ) and the newly created Financial Services Committee ( FSC ) .
The ECB closely followed all discussions at the European level that were of relevance for the pursuit of its tasks , taking part , in particular , in discussions concerning the draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe ( draft Constitution ) , the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines and the Stability and Growth Pact .
draft Constitution and transmitted it to the European Council .
In accordance with Article 48 of the Treaty on European Union ( TEU ) , the Italian Presidency of the Council convened an Intergovernmental Conference ( IGC ) to discuss and formally adopt changes to the existing Treaties .
The IGC started its proceedings in October .
At the European Council meeting on 12 and 13 December 2003 , the Heads of State or Government could not reach an overall agreement on the draft Constitution .
The European Council invited the Irish Presidency to make an assessment of the prospects for progress and report to the European Council in March 2004 .
The ECB followed the progress of both the Convention and the IGC very closely and contributed to their deliberations on issues of relevance to the tasks and mandate of the ECB and the ESCB .
These contributions included two letters sent by the President of the ECB to the Chairman of the Convention in May and June 2003 to convey suggestions of the Governing Council for improvements to preliminary drafts of the Constitution .
Both letters were made public on the ECB 's website .
In the summer of 2003 the Italian Presidency of the Council transmitted the Convention 's draft Constitution to the Council as a formal proposal for the amendment of the Treaties and formally invited the ECB to deliver an opinion .
The competence of the ECB to deliver an opinion is based on Article 48 of the TEU , which requires the consultation of the ECB in the event of institutional changes in the monetary area .
1 In this opinion , the ECB welcomed the draft Constitution as simplifying , streamlining and clarifying the legal and institutional framework of the European Union . The ECB reaffirmed its understanding that the necessary transfer of the provisions on the ECB and the ESCB from the present Treaty to the Constitution would not entail any changes to the substance of their 1 CON / 2003/20 , OJ C 229 , 25.9.2003 , p. 7 .
1.1 POLICY ISSUES CONSTITUTION FOR EUROPE In July 2003 the European Convention on the future of Europe ( Convention ) finalised the 128
ECB Annual Report 2003 tasks , mandate , status and legal regime .
While attaching great value to institutional and operational stability in the monetary domain , the ECB also signalled its awareness of the fact that a new Constitution had necessary implications for the institutional framework . However , it considered that the adjustments and updates that the constitutional process was envisaging did not affect that stability .
Despite this generally positive assessment , the ECB 's opinion identified some articles in the draft Constitution which were of relevance for the exercise of the ECB 's and ESCB 's functions and tasks and would benefit from further clarification and adjustment .
The ECB 's principal suggestions were to introduce a reference to Â« non-inflationary growth Â» or Â« price stability Â» in Article I-3 ( 3 ) on the Union 's objectives , to clarify the ECB 's status in the institutional framework , to add a reference to the ESCB and the Eurosystem in the heading of Article I-29 , which deals with the ECB , the Eurosystem and the ESCB , to recognise the independence of NCBs in this Article , to introduce a reference to the widely recognised term Â« Eurosystem Â» in the draft Constitution and to add an explicit reference to the responsibilities of the ESCB in Article III-90 on the external representation of the euro .
The ECB intervened formally in the negotiations of the IGC on one occasion . The Council Presidency had proposed to significantly extend the current simplified amendment procedure for changes to Article 10.2 of the Statute of the ESCB ( for further details regarding the current procedure , see Chapter 8 ) .
The new procedure would have covered any change to the basic provisions governing the decision-making bodies of the ECB and allowed for amendments to be made without ratification by the Member States .
In a letter to the President of the EU Council dated 26 November 2003 , the ECB 's President emphasised that the Governing Council had serious concerns about this proposal , regarding it as a far-reaching change to the current constitution of the ESCB .
As a result , the Council Presidency decided to drop the proposal .
2003 BROAD ECONOMIC POLICY GUIDELINES The Broad Economic Policy Guidelines adopted in 2003 by the ECOFIN Council not only called for continued sound public finances but also placed considerable emphasis on structural reforms .
In line with the Lisbon strategy , Member States were urged to pursue policies aimed at integrating capital markets and to increase competition in goods and services markets .
In addition to recommendations to improve the functioning of labour markets through sound wage bargaining arrangements and effective tax and benefit systems , the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines also paid special attention to the long-term sustainability of public finances in view of the ageing of the population of the EU .
From a procedural point of view , the 2003 Broad Economic Policy Guidelines were for the first time adopted for a three-year period , from 2003 to 2005 ( as were the Employment Guidelines ) .
This new procedure reflects a desire to pay greater attention to the implementation of policies , rather than to the frequent adoption of new guidelines .
The ECB was involved in the discussions on the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines through its participation in the EFC and the EPC .
In this context , the ECB welcomed the focus of the Guidelines on stability-oriented macroeconomic policies and structural reforms as well as the increased emphasis on their implementation .
In its public statements and publications , the ECB continuously stressed that the implementation of structural reforms needed to be accelerated in order to enhance the growth potential of the euro area .
In particular , the ECB sought to raise awareness of the need to reform labour markets and integrate financial markets ( see also Box 5 ) .
ECOFIN COUNCIL REPORT ON STRENGTHENING THE COORDINATION OF BUDGETARY POLICIES In November 2002 , in response to a request by the European Council , the Commission ECB Annual Report 2003
presented proposals to strengthen the coordination of budgetary policies . The ECOFIN Council subsequently reviewed the Commission 's proposals and , in March 2003 , adopted its own Â« Report on strengthening the coordination of budgetary policies Â» .
In its report , the ECOFIN Council agreed with the Commission that there was no need to change either the Treaty or the Stability and Growth Pact , or to introduce new budgetary objectives or rules .
At the same time , the ECOFIN Council shared the Commission 's view that there were areas where implementation could be improved .
For example , the ECOFIN Council felt that , while the monitoring of nominal balances continued to be essential , compliance with the close-to-balance-or-in-surplus requirement of the Stability and Growth Pact should be assessed in cyclically adjusted terms .
Moreover , the ECOFIN Council considered that , when assessing Member States Â» budgetary policies , attention should be paid to countryspecific circumstances , such as the quality and long-term sustainability of public finances and the safety margin needed to prevent a breach of the deficit reference value of 3 % of GDP .
The ECOFIN Council also stressed that countries with deficits exceeding the close-to-balance-orin-surplus requirement of the Stability and Growth Pact must improve their cyclically adjusted budget position .
In this context , the ECOFIN Council recalled the Eurogroup agreement of 7 October 2002 that euro area countries whose deficits exceed the close-tobalance-or-in-surplus requirement should reduce their underlying deficits by at least 0.5% of GDP per year .
Throughout the discussions on the Commission 's proposals , the ECB stressed that the rules and procedures of the Stability and Growth Pact provide an appropriate framework for fiscal policies in EMU .
The ECB therefore fully supported the view of the ECOFIN Council that changes to the Stability and Growth Pact were not warranted .
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE STABILITY AND GROWTH PACT In 2003 the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact was at a critical juncture .
In an economic environment that was less favourable than previously expected , those Member States that had failed to reach sound budgetary positions during the previous upturn found it increasingly difficult -- and , in some cases , were already seen to have failed -- to respect the deficit reference value of 3 % of GDP .
In 2002 the ECOFIN Council had decided that an excessive deficit existed in Portugal and issued a recommendation to Portugal with a view to bringing the situation of an excessive deficit to an end by 2003 at the latest .
During 2003 the excessive deficit procedure for Portugal was held in abeyance pending this correction ( see Box 11 for an overview of the excessive deficit procedure ) .
In January 2003 the ECOFIN Council adopted a decision on the existence of an excessive deficit in Germany and issued a recommendation to Germany with a view to bringing the situation of an excessive deficit to an end .
The ECOFIN Council recommended that the German authorities adopt the corrective measures foreseen in their budgetary plans amounting to 1 % of GDP in 2003 and that the excessive deficit be corrected as rapidly as possible and by 2004 at the latest .
The deficit and debt figures certified by Eurostat in March 2003 subsequently showed that France 's budget deficit also exceeded the 3 % of GDP reference value in 2002 .
As a consequence , the ECOFIN Council adopted a decision in June 2003 on the existence of an excessive deficit in France and issued a recommendation to France with a view to bringing the situation of an excessive deficit to an end .
The ECOFIN Council recommended that the French authorities achieve a significantly larger improvement than planned at the time in the cyclically adjusted deficit in 2003 , and that the excessive deficit be corrected as rapidly as possible and by 2004 at the latest .
ECB Annual Report 2003 In view of continued adverse fiscal developments in France and Germany , the Commission decided in October and November to initiate the next steps of the excessive deficit procedures for these countries .
To this end , the Commission issued recommendations for Council decisions on whether effective action had been taken or was proving adequate , and recommendations for Council decisions giving notice to France and Germany to take the necessary measures to reduce their deficits .
The Commission expressed the view that France had not taken effective action , while the action taken by Germany was deemed inadequate .
The Commission recommended extending the deadline for France and Germany to correct their excessive deficits from 2004 to 2005 , citing worse than expected economic conditions in these countries .
At its meeting on 25 November 2003 , the ECOFIN Council decided not to adopt the decisions recommended by the Commission , explaining this action on the basis of both the worse than expected economic climate and the budgetary commitments made by the French and German governments .
Instead , it adopted Council conclusions in which it decided to hold the excessive deficit procedures in abeyance and called on France and Germany to take measures that would ensure the correction of their excessive deficits by 2005 .
In a statement issued immediately after the ECOFIN Council meeting on 25 November , the Governing Council expressed its deep regret regarding the decisions taken by the ECOFIN Council . The Governing Council warned that the failure of the ECOFIN Council to follow the rules and procedures foreseen in the Stability and Growth Pact risked undermining the credibility of the institutional framework and confidence in the soundness of the public finances of countries across the euro area .
Noting the budgetary commitments by France and Germany , the Governing Council urged the governments concerned to live up to their responsibilities , pointing out that it was imperative that action be taken to limit negative effects on confidence .
The Governing Council also reassured the public that it remained committed to maintaining price stability .
On 28 January 2004 the Commission brought an action before the European Court of Justice , challenging the ECOFIN Council conclusions of 25 November 2003 with a view to seeking legal clarity regarding the application of the relevant provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact .
The ECB shares the concerns of the Commission regarding the ECOFIN Council conclusions and respects the Commission 's decision to seek legal clarity in this matter . On the same day the Commission announced that it would put forward proposals to strengthen economic governance in the euro area , including improvements to the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact .
The clarity and enforceability of the fiscal rules should also be enhanced . 1.2 INSTITUTIONAL CHANGES RELATING TO RELEVANT EUROPEAN BODIES On 16 April 2003 the Accession Treaty was signed , paving the way for the entry of ten new Member States into the EU as of 1 May 2004 .
As is customary following the signing of an accession treaty , representatives of the acceding countries have been granted observer status in those Community institutions and bodies in which Member States are represented .
Box 11 THE EXCESSIVE DEFICIT PROCEDURE The excessive deficit procedure lays down the steps to be taken to assess and decide whether an excessive deficit exists and to ensure its timely correction .
It is based on Article 104 of the Treaty and on Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure .
The latter is part of the Stability and Growth Pact .
When the ratio of the planned or actual government deficit to GDP exceeds a reference value of 3 % and this excess is not small and temporary , or if the ratio of government debt to GDP exceeds a reference value of 60 % and is not diminishing at a satisfactory pace , the Commission prepares a report .
The EFC prepares an opinion on this report and , if the Commission considers that an excessive deficit exists , the Commission addresses an opinion to the ECOFIN Council .
On the basis of a recommendation by the Commission , the ECOFIN Council adopts a decision on whether or not an excessive deficit exists .
If an excessive deficit is deemed to exist , the ECOFIN Council recommends that the Member State concerned correct its excessive deficit and sets a deadline of no more than four months for the Member State to adopt corrective measures .
The ECOFIN Council also sets a deadline for the correction of the excessive deficit , which should be completed in the year following its identification unless there are special circumstances .
If the Member State adopts the recommended measures , the procedure is held in abeyance and the Commission and ECOFIN Council monitor their implementation .
If the measures are not adopted , the ECOFIN Council takes a decision to this effect and , within one month , gives notice to the Member State to take measures to reduce the deficit .
The content of the notice may or may not differ from that of the earlier recommendation depending on developments in the meantime .
If these measures are adopted , the procedure is again held in abeyance and the Commission and the ECOFIN Council monitor their implementation .
If , however , the necessary measures are not adopted within a period of no more than two months , as set by the ECOFIN Council , the ECOFIN Council takes a decision to impose sanctions .
When the ECOFIN Council decides to impose sanctions , as a rule , a non-interest-bearing deposit is required .
If the excessive deficit is not corrected after two years , the deposit is , as a rule , converted into a fine .
In summary , the excessive deficit procedure consists of three main steps .
First , the decision that an excessive deficit exists and the issuing of recommendations by the ECOFIN Council to the Member State concerned .
Second , a notice by the ECOFIN Council to the Member State to take measures to reduce the deficit .
And , third , the imposition of sanctions .
If it emerges at any point in time that the measures adopted by the Member State are not being implemented or are not effective , the ECOFIN Council proceeds to the next step of the procedure .
The potential imposition of sanctions provides the ultimate incentive for the Member State to correct its excessive deficit in a timely manner .
ECB Annual Report 2003
In order to ensure that they will continue to function effectively after enlargement , both the EFC and the EPC reviewed their composition and working methods in the first half of 2003 .
Following these reviews , on 18 June 2003 the ECOFIN Council amended the statutes of these two committees .
In the case of the EPC , it was decided to reduce the number of members that each delegation appoints to the committee .
Whereas previously the Member States , the Commission and the ECB could each appoint up to four members , the number of members per delegation has been reduced to two under the new statutes .
In the case of the EFC , by contrast , it was decided to leave the membership of the committee unchanged .
The Member States , the Commission and the ECB will continue to appoint two members each . Moreover , the two members appointed by each of the Member States will continue to be selected from among senior officials from , respectively , the administration and the NCB .
However , it was decided to vary participation in meetings of the committee depending on the issues discussed .
Whenever the committee discusses issues related to the tasks and expertise of NCBs , the committee will meet in its Â« full composition Â» , with all members present .
Otherwise , the committee may meet in its Â« restricted composition Â» , with only the members from administrations , the Commission and the ECB attending .
The committee deems it important to retain the expertise and analytical insight of the NCBs , and to keep them involved in issues for which they bear responsibility .
The review of the EFC 's working methods took place not only in view of enlargement , but also against the background of the new EU arrangements for financial stability , regulation and supervision ( see Section 2 of Chapter 3 ) .
In this regard , at its meeting on 3 December 2002 the ECOFIN Council asked the EFC to report to it on financial stability issues . In response to this mandate , the EFC now undertakes regular reviews of financial stability .
Relevant nonmembers , including the Chairman of the ESCB 's Banking Supervision Committee , attend the meetings dedicated to this review .
In February 2003 the ECOFIN Council established the FSC , which replaced the former Financial Services Policy Group .
It reports to the EFC and has the task of providing advice to the ECOFIN Council and the Commission on a wide range of policy issues affecting financial markets . The ECB has been granted observer status in the FSC .
2 I N T E R N AT I O N A L I S S U E S The ECB and NCBs continued to participate in the process of monetary , financial and economic cooperation at the international level .
The arrangements for the international representation of the ECB remained unchanged .
Within the EU , the coordination of international macroeconomic and financial issues continued in the context of the EFC , as well as among the IMF Executive Directors representing the EU Member States , including the ECB Observer .
On 29 May 2003 the President of the United States issued an executive order extending to the ECB the privileges , exemptions and immunities provided to public international organisations under the Â« International Organizations Immunities Act Â» of 1945 . This followed the passage by the US Congress in November 2002 of legislation providing for the applicability of this Act to the ECB .
The new legal framework should not only ensure better protection of the ECB 's assets held in the United States , but also facilitate a further strengthening of bilateral relations with relevant US institutions .
world economic and market developments .
Finally , at the OECD , the ECB participated in the activities of the Economic Policy Committee , which focused on global economic developments , prospects and policy requirements .
The IMF and the OECD conducted their regular reviews of the monetary , financial and economic policies of the euro area .
The IMF decided to streamline , from 2003 onwards , its surveillance of euro area policies by reducing the number of fully-fledged Article IV consultations on those policies from two to one per year .
The IMF also decided that IMF staff would continue to carry out two missions per year to the euro area authorities , including the ECB , but that the IMF Executive Board would discuss the outcome of the second mission only informally .
The fully-fledged Article IV report on euro area policies , prepared by IMF staff , was published in September 2003 .
In July 2003 the OECD published its Economic Survey of the Euro Area , which reviewed recent developments and short-term prospects , as well as fiscal , monetary and structural policies , and included a study on product market competition policies .
The survey , prepared by an OECD team on the basis of , inter alia , a visit to the ECB , was finalised by the Economic and Development Review Committee of the OECD in which the Eurogroup Presidency , the European Commission and the ECB jointly represented the EU . MONITORING OF DEVELOPMENTS IN GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS A number of international organisations and fora monitor global financial market developments .
In 2003 the ECB and NCBs participated in these monitoring activities , providing their own analysis and views , particularly in the Financial Stability Forum ( FSF ) , the BIS-based Committee on the Global Financial System ( CGFS ) and the OECD 's Committee on Financial Markets . 2.1 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY AND FINANCIAL SYSTEM MULTILATERAL AND BILATERAL SURVEILLANCE OF MACROECONOMIC POLICIES The ECB regularly exchanged information and views on economic developments and policies with policy-makers outside the euro area and with international institutions .
The President of the ECB , together with the Eurogroup Presidency , participated in the global surveillance and exchange rate sessions of the meetings of G7 finance ministers and central bank governors .
The President of the ECB also participated in the discussions on the state of the world economy in other fora , such as the meetings of the G10 governors , which he currently chairs , and those of the ministers and governors of the G10 and the G20 .
At the IMF , the ECB Observer took part in the IMF Executive Board 's discussions on the world economic outlook and its regular reviews of 134
ECB Annual Report 2003 The ECB Observer participated in the IMF Executive Board discussions on the IMF 's Global Financial Stability Reports .
The ECB also participated as a member or observer in the work of a number of international institutions and fora on specific aspects of the functioning of international financial markets .
The FSF reviewed issues related to the reinsurance industry , credit risk transfers , audit practices , accounting standards , corporate governance and offshore financial centres .
The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision continued its work on the new Capital Accord ( see Section 2 of Chapter 3 ) .
The CGFS published reports on Â« Credit risk transfer Â» and Â« Incentive structures in institutional asset management and their implications for financial markets Â» and launched work on studying the role of rating agencies in the area of structured finance and foreign direct investment in the financial sectors of emerging market economies .
The ECB also took part in the activities of the Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems ( CPSS ) , which is chaired by a member of the ECB 's Executive Board ( see Section 4 of Chapter 3 ) .
INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL ARCHITECTURE The ESCB contributed with its own assessment and analysis to the ongoing discussions on the architecture of the international financial system in the IMF and related fora , both through direct participation and through its involvement in EU coordination .
This included work on the promotion of economic and financial stability , inter alia through improved debt sustainability assessments and greater attention to potential balance sheet weaknesses in emerging market economies .
The international community also studied the contribution of institution-building to economic performance .
In that context , the G20 held a discussion on the role of institution-building in the financial sector on the basis of case studies prepared by a number of G20 members , including an ECB contribution on experience with financial integration in the EU .
2 With regard to the orderly resolution of financial crises in emerging market economies , the IMF completed its review of access policy , i.e. the rules for determining the volume of financial assistance to be given to a member country that is experiencing balance of payment difficulties .
The IMF Executive Board agreed on a number of procedural requirements and substantive criteria governing access to its resources beyond the normal limits , which are proportional to the quota assigned to each IMF member country .
The debate continued on procedures to facilitate orderly sovereign debt restructuring .
The ESCB took the view that further progress was desirable with respect to the three broad groups of instruments that had been proposed .
3 One proposal involved modifying the contractual framework by including collective action clauses ( CACs ) aimed at facilitating coordination among creditors .
This proposal is already being implemented . In the course of 2003 there was significant progress towards a more widespread inclusion of CACs in sovereign bonds issued under foreign jurisdictions .
In an effort to lead by example , the EU Member States committed themselves to including such CACs in their relevant issues .
A second proposal was the establishment of a Sovereign Debt Restructuring Mechanism ( SDRM ) , a type of international bankruptcy procedure which would have been embedded in international law . At the spring meeting of the IMFC in April 2003 , however , it became clear that there was insufficient political support for the creation of even a soft version of such a mechanism .
Nevertheless , it remains to be explored to what extent specific features of the SDRM -- such as the enhancement of transparency and disclosure , 2 3 Â« Globalisation : The role of institution building in the financial sector -- The EU experience Â» , ECB , November 2003 .
For more details see the article entitled Â« Crisis resolution in emerging market economies -- challenges for the international community Â» in the November 2003 issue of the ECB 's Monthly Bulletin .
aggregation across debt issues and the creation of a dispute resolution forum -- could be replicated outside an international legal framework . A third proposal was to develop a code of conduct to be implemented on a voluntary basis , which would set out best practices and guidelines for borrowers , lenders and the international official community .
THE INTERNATIONAL ROLE OF THE EURO In 2003 the ECB continued its analysis of the international role of the euro .
4 It undertook work to improve its statistical framework and its analytical understanding of the use of the euro by non-euro area residents .
New data were made available , in particular on the currency breakdown of the external trade of selected euro area countries , on daily foreign exchange transactions settled through Continuous Linked Settlement ( CLS ) and on the euro 's role in the international loan market .
The ECB also launched work in 2003 on analysing at the microeconomic level the markets where the euro is mostly used by noneuro area residents .
Particular attention was paid to the City of London 's contribution to the role of the euro in financial markets outside the euro area .
Overall , the results of this review confirmed that the international role of the euro continues to grow gradually , that it is characterised by a strong regional focus and that it is , to a certain extent , driven by the euro area itself .
The results also provided a clearer picture of both the geographical distribution of the users of the euro and the extent of its global role .
In countries that are geographically remote from Europe , agents have thus far used the euro primarily to borrow funds ( issuance of debt securities ) and in foreign exchange transactions .
Large US corporations have been very active issuers of euro-denominated bonds since the start of Stage Three of EMU , in particular to diversify their investor base .
Financial centres in the United States and Asia together accounted for a not insignificant proportion of foreign exchange activity in euro .
There are indications that financial market participants from some of these countries tend to use the City of London as an entry point for their euro-denominated financial activities .
In addition , according to market sources , demand from Asian investors for euro-denominated bonds issued by non-euro area residents increased in 2003 , which points to a broader role of the euro as an international investment currency .
However , the use of the euro as an international currency remains most prominent in countries neighbouring the euro area .
In financial markets outside the euro area , a major role is played by the City of London . The share of the City of London in financial activity in euro by non-euro area residents typically ranges from one-third to two-thirds .
Finally , additional evidence gained in 2003 suggests that the euro area is itself an important determinant of the international role of its currency , as it is a large and financially open economy .
Since the start of Stage Three of EMU , euro-denominated bonds issued by non-euro area residents have to a significant extent been targeted at and purchased by euro area investors .
Moreover , work conducted in 2003 highlighted that euro area-owned banks are among the largest players in euro-denominated markets in the City of London , thereby contributing substantially to the euro 's role in financial markets outside the euro area . 2.2 COOPERATION WITH COUNTRIES OUTSIDE THE EU As part of its international activities , the ECB continued in 2003 to develop a broad range of bilateral relations as well as contacts in multilateral frameworks with countries in various other regions of the world .
Furthermore , relations with key emerging market economies in Asia and the Pacific and in Latin America were deepened . In November 2003 the Eurosystem started implementing a two-year project to provide technical assistance to the Central Bank of Russia ( CBR ) , funded by the European Union within the framework of its programme of Technical Assistance for the Commonwealth of Independent States ( TACIS programme ) .
The project covers banking supervision and regulation , inspection and licensing , as well as bank rehabilitation . It draws on the vast experience which NCBs and supervisory authorities in the EU have in the field of banking supervision .
Nine NCBs 5 and three EU non-central bank supervisors 6 will assign experts to provide training to around 400 members of the staff and management of the CBR over 24 months . The training will consist of courses and seminars , most of which will take place in Moscow at the CBR premises , as well as study visits by CBR experts to EU countries .
The ECB is coordinating the project . With this project , the Eurosystem intends to contribute to further strengthening the CBR 's banking supervision function as a key measure to foster a more stable financial environment .
The ECB continued its high-level policy dialogue with the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey ( CBRT ) . Turkey currently has the status of a candidate country for EU accession .
7 The discussions with the CBRT focused on Turkey 's macroeconomic stabilisation process , the planned introduction of a formal inflationtargeting framework by the CBRT and the economic situation in the euro area .
In addition to the policy dialogue , technical cooperation between various business areas of the ECB and the CBRT continued throughout 2003 .
Over the past few years , the ECB has established bilateral relations with central banks in the Mediterranean region . In October 2003 the ECB , in cooperation with the Banca d' Italia , organised a technical workshop for representatives of the central banks of the
This seminar focused on economic and financial relations between the euro area and the Mediterranean countries , on exchange rate arrangements and on financial sector reforms highlighted by the workshop participants . In the Middle East , the ECB further developed its relations with the Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) in view of the intention of the six GCC member states 9 to launch a single currency by 2010 .
In 2003 bilateral relations with central banks in Africa continued to focus on issues related to monetary unions . Several events provided the ECB with the opportunity to contribute to the discussions in the region on the basis of the experience of EMU .
The Committee , which includes experts from the BCEAO , other central banks , governments and academia , is mandated to examine the BCEAO 5 The Deutsche Bundesbank , the Banco de EspaÃ±a , the Banque de France , the Central Bank & Financial Services Authority of Ireland , the Banca d' Italia , De Nederlandsche Bank , the Oesterreichische Nationalbank , the Banco de Portugal and Suomen Pankki -- Finlands Bank .
6 Rahoitustarkastus from Finland , the Finansinspektionen from Sweden and the Financial Services Authority from the United Kingdom .
7 The European Council in Helsinki in 1999 granted Turkey the status of a candidate for EU membership .
The European Council in Copenhagen in 2002 indicated that if the European Council in December 2004 decided that Turkey fulf illed the Copenhagen political criteria , the EU would open accession negotiations with Turkey without delay .

statutes and the institutional set-up of the monetary area without prejudice to the existing exchange rate arrangement .
Moreover , the ECB participated in the forum for finance ministers of the West African Monetary Zone 11 that was held in Accra , Ghana , to follow progress towards monetary integration between Englishspeaking countries in the region .
The ECB additionally attended the annual governors Â» forum of the Macroeconomic and Financial Management Institute of Eastern and Southern Africa , which brought together , in Basel , central bank governors from 12 African countries .
The forum discussed existing regional monetary union projects in Africa , as well as the lessons on monetary integration to be drawn from EMU .
In the course of the year , bilateral relations with East Asia were further strengthened , not least by a visit by a member of the Executive Board to Korea , Japan and Indonesia .
The ECB also participated in the fifth Asia-Europe ( ASEM ) Finance Ministers Â» Meeting in Bali , Indonesia , in July 2003 .
The contribution of the ECB focused on economic integration in the East Asian region , the role of central banks in crisis management and European experience with regulation and cooperation in pursuing financial stability .
In 2003 the ECB became a Â« collaborating member Â» of the Centre for Latin American Monetary Studies ( CEMLA ) , after having participated in an increasing number of CEMLA conferences and meetings since 1999 .
One of the main objectives of CEMLA is to promote a better understanding of monetary and banking matters in Latin America and the Caribbean , as well as to inform on developments in regional and international monetary and financial policies .
CEMLA also initiated a project to promote convergence at a sub-regional grouping level .

CHAPTER 5
ACCOUNTABILITY 1 A C C O U N TA B I L I T Y V I S - Ã - V I S T H E G E N E R A L PUBLIC Over the past decades , central bank independence has emerged as a key institutional feature of the economic policy frameworks of industrialised countries .
The decision to grant central banks independence from political influence is firmly grounded in historical experience , economic theory and empirical evidence , which shows that central bank independence is conducive to maintaining price stability and thus contributes to overall economic welfare .
At the same time , it is a fundamental principle of democratic societies that public authorities need to be accountable to the general public , from which their mandate and independence ultimately derive .
Accountability can be understood as the legal and institutional obligation of an independent central bank to explain its decisions clearly and thoroughly to citizens and their elected representatives , thereby holding the central bank responsible for achieving its objectives .
The Treaty establishing the European Community , which lays down the tasks and objectives of the ESCB , has been ratified by all EU Member States in line with their national constitutional requirements .
Thus , the European citizens have endowed the ESCB with the mandate to maintain price stability and , without prejudice to this primary objective , to support the general economic policies of the Community .
At the same time , the Treaty contains precise reporting requirements , which allow the European public and their elected representatives to hold the ECB responsible for attaining these objectives .
This institutional set-up has been reconfirmed by the Convention on the future of Europe and included in the draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe ( see Section 1 of Chapter 4 ) .
From its inception , the ECB has acknowledged the fundamental importance of its accountability obligations and therefore maintains a regular dialogue with European citizens and their elected representatives .
This commitment is reflected , inter alia , in the numerous public speeches held by members of the Governing Council throughout the euro area in 2003 .
Such contacts with European citizens allow the Eurosystem to explain the Governing Council 's policy decisions and to directly address any issues or concerns .
Beyond such direct contacts with European citizens , the Treaty lays down a number of reporting obligations for the ECB , of which the Annual Report -- addressed to the European Parliament , the EU Council , the Commission and the European Council -- is one example .
Other reporting requirements include the publication of a quarterly report and a weekly financial statement .
The ECB exceeds these requirements by publishing comprehensive bulletins on a monthly basis .
At the institutional level , the Treaty assigns a prominent role to the European Parliament with regard to the accountability of the ECB ( see Section 2 of this chapter ) .
In several respects , accountability is closely related to transparency .
Transparency means not only releasing information , but also structuring that information in such a way that the public can understand it .
Transparency facilitates the process of holding central banks accountable for their actions .
The ECB regards transparency as a crucial component of its monetary policy framework .
Transparency requires central banks to clearly explain how they interpret and implement their mandates . This helps the public to monitor and evaluate a central bank 's performance .
It also requires an explanation both of the analytical framework used for its internal decision-making and assessment of the state of the economy and of the economic rationale underlying its policy decisions .
Transparency is strongly enhanced by means of a publicly announced monetary policy strategy .
In line with these considerations , the ECB announced its monetary policy strategy in 1998 . This strategy was confirmed and clarified in May 2003 , following a thorough evaluation by the Governing Council ( see Section 1 of Chapter 1 ) .
The ECB thereby provided the general public with a clear benchmark against which the ECB 's performance can be assessed .
ECB Annual Report 2003 Transparency can render monetary policy more effective for several reasons .
First , a central bank can foster credibility by being clear about the interpretation of its mandate and how it goes about achieving it .
When a central bank is perceived as being determined and capable of achieving its policy mandate , it helps to anchor expectations about future price developments .
If , in turn , expectations are well anchored at levels compatible with price stability , there is less reason for economic agents to deviate from the assumption of price stability when setting wages or prices and there is also a lower risk of an inflationary or deflationary wage-price spiral developing .
Second , a strong commitment to transparency imposes self-discipline on policy-makers , which , in turn , helps to ensure that their policy decisions and explanations are consistent over time .
Facilitating public scrutiny of monetary policy decisions enhances the incentives for decision-making bodies to fulfil their mandates in an appropriate and consistent manner .
Third , by publicly announcing its monetary policy strategy and communicating its regular assessment of economic developments , the central bank provides guidance to the markets so that expectations can be formed more efficiently and accurately .
This helps financial markets to better understand the response pattern of monetary policy to economic developments and thus to anticipate the broad direction of monetary policy over the medium term .
This , in turn , should contribute to smoothing financial market developments .
In order to ensure that it is both accountable and transparent , the ECB uses a variety of communication tools , which go far beyond the reporting requirements laid down in the Treaty and which are explained in more detail in Chapter 6 . 1

2 A C C O U N TA B I L I T Y V I S - Ã - V I S T H E E U R O P E A N PARLIAMENT 2.1 OVERVIEW OF RELATIONS WITH THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT IN 2003 In line with the provisions of Article 113 of the Treaty , the ECB continued to report regularly to the European Parliament on the decisions taken in the field of monetary policy and its other tasks .
As in past years , the main forum for the exchange of views between the ECB and the European Parliament were the quarterly testimonies by the President of the ECB before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
The President was also invited to present the ECB 's Annual Report 2002 at the plenary session of the European Parliament .
Moreover , in line with common practice , other members of the Executive Board were also invited to appear before the European Parliament for an exchange of views on a variety of topics .
In April 2003 the VicePresident presented the ECB 's Annual Report 2002 to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs .
In March the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs heard Mr Issing 's views on the economic environment and on the draft Broad Economic Policy Guidelines for 2003-2005 .
Beyond the scope of its Treaty obligations , the ECB continued its voluntary practice of replying to written questions submitted by members of the European Parliament on issues regarding the fulfilment of the ECB 's mandate .
Finally , the role of the European Parliament in the appointment of a new President and other members of the Executive Board should also be mentioned .
Article 112 of the Treaty stipulates that the European Parliament shall give its opinion on candidates prior to their appointment by common accord of the governments of the Member States at the level of Heads of State or Government .
In order to prepare its opinions , the European Parliament invited Mr Trichet and Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell to appear before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to present their views and answer questions from Committee members .
Following these hearings , the plenary of the European Parliament endorsed both appointments .
2.2 VIEWS OF THE ECB ON SELECTED TOPICS RAISED AT MEETINGS WITH THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT While the testimonies before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs covered a wide range of policy areas , the main focus was on the ECB 's monetary policy decisions and its assessment of the economic and monetary developments underlying these decisions .
The following sub-sections deal with other important issues raised by the European Parliament and recall the views presented by the ECB .
Many of these issues are also addressed in the European Parliament resolution of 3 July 2003 on the Annual Report presented by the ECB last year .
REFORM OF THE VOTING MODALITIES OF THE GOVERNING COUNCIL In accordance with Article 10.6 of the Statute of the ESCB , on 3 February 2003 the ECB submitted a recommendation to the EU Council for a reform of the voting modalities of the Governing Council ( see Section 1 of Chapter 8 for further details ) .
The above-mentioned Article also stipulates that the European Commission and the European Parliament shall be consulted prior to any decision by the EU Council .
In February 2003 the President of the ECB presented the recommendation to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs . During the debate , the recommendation met with criticism .
In its opinion of 13 March 2003 , the European Parliament rejected the ECB 's recommendation and suggested maintaining the existing rules , whereby all NCB governors of the Eurosystem have the right to vote in the Governing Council .
In March 2003 the EU Council meeting in the composition of the Heads of State or Government unanimously adopted the new voting modalities of the Governing Council , 144
ECB Annual Report 2003 endorsing the ECB 's recommendation .
The reform of the voting modalities will enter into force following ratification by all Member States in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements .
The new voting modalities will apply once the number of NCB governors in the Governing Council exceeds 15 .
EVALUATION OF THE ECB' S MONETARY POLICY STRATEGY The President reported to the European Parliament on the outcome of the Governing Council 's evaluation of the ECB 's monetary policy strategy ( for further details , see Section 1 of Chapter 1 ) .
A number of members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs welcomed the confirmation and clarification of the strategy , in particular as regards the definition of price stability , and said it ensured the continuity of the ECB 's policy .
Other Committee members raised the issue of whether the ECB 's monetary policy strategy was symmetric in terms of avoiding both inflation and deflation , and whether the ECB 's definition of price stability would take sufficient account of a potential measurement bias in the HICP .
The President explained that the ECB would continue to remain vigilant in terms of avoiding both inflation and deflation .
In this respect , the recent clarification that , in the pursuit of price stability , the Governing Council would aim to maintain inflation rates below , but close to , 2 % of an annual increase in the HICP over the medium term , ensured a significant and adequate safety margin to guard against the risk of deflation .
He added that , although the size of the measurement bias in the euro area was still uncertain , available studies indicated that it was likely to be limited .
By making it clear that price stability should be maintained over the medium term , the ECB took account of the fact that it was impossible for a central bank to fine-tune short-term price developments and that these could therefore temporarily exceed the level of price increases regarded as compatible with price stability .
In its resolution on the ECB 's Annual Report 2002 , the European Parliament welcomed the evaluation of the ECB 's monetary policy strategy and expressed its belief Â« that the clarifications will strengthen the appropriateness of the policy strategy for the years to come Â» .
ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY Accountability and transparency once again figured prominently in the exchanges between the ECB and the European Parliament .
The views of both institutions remained , in substance , unchanged .
In its resolution on the ECB 's Annual Report 2002 , the European Parliament reiterated its call for both the publication of summary minutes and the balance of votes in Governing Council meetings .
The President recalled that the ECB 's policy on these issues reflected the specific institutional environment in which the ECB operated , with monetary policy decisions being taken at the euro area level and economic policies remaining largely the responsibility of the individual Member States .
Given that this arrangement ran the risk of making Governing Council members seem like national representatives , the ECB had decided not to provide any indications that could reveal -- or lead to speculations about -- individual voting behaviour .
This would help to ensure that Governing Council decisions continued to be taken exclusively from a euro area perspective .
The ECB 's approach also helped to focus public attention on the outcome of policy deliberations rather than on individual voting behaviour .
Thus it ensured that its messages were clear , thereby enhancing the effectiveness and predictability of its monetary policy decisions .
Finally , the President recalled that the communication channels chosen by the ECB , in particular the monthly press conferences held immediately after the Governing Council meetings , were more effective in terms of timeliness than the publication of minutes . On a more general level , the President emphasised the fact that the exchanges of views ECB Annual Report 2003
with the European Parliament were carefully assessed and taken into account in the deliberations of the ECB 's decision-making bodies .
For example , the President mentioned the publication of the staff economic projections , which had come about as a result of a request from the European Parliament .
Indeed , the ECB would continue to seek ways of enhancing its accountability and transparency wherever the accomplishment of its policy objectives allowed .
INTERNATIONAL ROLE OF THE EURO AND EXTERNAL REPRESENTATION OF THE EURO AREA Another policy area considered in much detail by the European Parliament in 2003 was the international role of the euro and the external representation of the euro area .
Several members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs called for more active policies in order to contribute to a greater use of the single currency at the international level , for instance as an invoicing currency for the import of commodities and energy supplies to the euro area .
Moreover , in its resolution on the international role of the euro area and its first assessment of the introduction of banknotes and coins , adopted on 3 July 2003 , the European Parliament suggested the appointment of a single representative for the euro area , who would be given Â« broad powers to speak and act on behalf of euro zone countries in all important multilateral financial and economic fora Â» .
In the European Parliament 's view , this role could be performed by a Vice-President of the European Commission responsible for Economic and Monetary Affairs .
The President recalled that , in the view of the ECB , the international role of the euro was essentially market-driven .
Against this background , the ECB would neither encourage nor discourage non-euro area residents to use the euro . At the same time , the President also said that the international role of the single currency had gradually increased over the past few years .
He shared the European Parliament 's view that there was a need to improve the statistical framework for monitoring the use of the euro at the international level , an objective to which the ECB was actively contributing and which was also addressed in its legal opinions .
As regards the external representation of the euro area , the President emphasised that as far as the euro was concerned , the ECB would continue to act as the institution expressing the euro area 's positions internationally , in line with its responsibilities , as set out in the Treaty .
According to its mandate , the ECB , as represented by members of its decision-making bodies , was the single external voice of the euro area for all matters related to the single monetary policy , a role that had also been endorsed by the Convention on the future of Europe .

EXTERNAL COMMUNIC ATION
1 C O M M U N I C AT I O N P O L I C Y Communication is an integral part of the ECB 's monetary policy and the performance of its other tasks .
In its communication with the public , the media and specialised audiences -- such as financial market participants -- the ECB seeks to contribute to the effectiveness , efficiency and credibility of its monetary policy .
A further objective is to give full account of its actions , as explained in more detail in Chapter 5 .
In order to achieve these objectives , the ECB must be open and transparent .
It must enhance the public 's knowledge and understanding of its tasks and policies as well as its close collaboration with the NCBs in the Eurosystem .
The ESCB 's communication efforts are targeted at audiences in the EU with particular focus on the euro area . It is therefore important for the ESCB to be able to address a variety of regional and national audiences in their own languages and environments .
In this context , the decentralised framework of the ESCB is instrumental in ensuring the proper dissemination of information to the general public and to interested parties .
Communication experts from the ECB and the NCBs regularly exchange views in order to coordinate their efforts .
In view of the forthcoming enlargement of the EU , the ESCB 's communication efforts have also been increasingly directed towards audiences in the acceding countries . The ECB closely cooperates with the acceding country central banks , thus broadening the geographical scope of its external communication .
2 C O M M U N I C AT I O N T O O L S The ECB uses a number of communication tools in order to meet the above-mentioned objectives .
The most important channels of communication are the monthly press conferences held by the President and the VicePresident , which are an essential tool for realtime communication , the Monthly Bulletin and the Annual Report .
The press conferences and the Monthly Bulletin are used to present the ECB 's assessment of economic developments and explain monetary policy decisions in a transparent and timely manner .
The ECB remains one of the most transparent central banks in the world .
The concept of a regular , real-time and detailed explanation of the ECB 's policy , assessments and decisions , introduced in 1999 , represents a uniquely open and transparent approach to central bank communication .
The Annual Report is also particularly important , as it is one of the statutory publications of the ECB and is addressed to the European Parliament , the EU Council , the European Commission and the European Council .
It presents the activities of the ESCB and the monetary policy of both the previous and the current year , and thus helps to hold the ECB accountable for its actions .
The Monthly Bulletin also contains articles providing information on longer-term developments , general central banking topics and the analytical tools used by the Eurosystem for the monetary policy strategy .
A list of articles published in 2003 can be found in the annex on documents published by the ECB .
In January 2004 the Monthly Bulletin was published for the first time in its new format . This new format provided the basis for a review of the format of other publications and will eventually lead to the adoption of a new corporate design for all ECB publications .
The President of the ECB makes quarterly appearances in the form of testimonies before the European Parliament 's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and once a year before the European Parliament at its plenary session .
Other members of the Executive Board of the ECB are also invited to appear before the Committee ( see Section 2 of Chapter 5 ) .
Speeches and interviews given by members of the ECB 's decision-making bodies also constitute an important means of communication .
Furthermore , as part of its regular reporting to the financial sector and the general public , the ECB publishes press releases on relevant Governing Council decisions , on special studies conducted by the ECB and on other topics of interest .
Dialogue with financial market participants and with other interested parties is sometimes formalised through public consultation procedures . In 2003 this instrument was used to receive their views on issues related to payment and securities settlement systems , as well as to the collateral framework of the Eurosystem ( see Chapter 2 ) .
In addition , the ECB contributes to the dissemination of research findings on the whole range of central bank activities by publishing Working Papers and Occasional Papers and organising academic conferences , seminars and workshops .
In 2003 the main events of this kind included the Â« Seminar on Banknote Substrates Â» , the conference on Â« Private and public sector challenges in the payment system Â» , organised by the ECB and the G10 Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems , the Â« Insolvency Symposium Â» , jointly sponsored with the BIS , the conference on Â« Prices , Productivity and Growth Â» organised in collaboration with the Banco de EspaÃ±a , the conference on the Â« Euro Area Business Cycle Network Â» , the Â« International Research Forum on Monetary Policy Â» in Washington D.C. , and a number of other workshops organised in collaboration with various academic associations and euro area NCBs .
All documents published by the ECB are available on the ECB 's website ( www.ecb.int ) , ECB Annual Report 2003
which also serves as a contact point for queries from the public and as a platform for the launch of public consultations .
The use of the website has grown rapidly over recent years .
In particular , the Â« Statistics Â» , Â« Press releases Â» and Â« Job opportunities Â» sections are frequently visited .
In 2003 the ECB began redesigning its website to facilitate searches for specific documents and to aid navigation between the various sections .
Another important objective was to enhance the accessibility of the website not only for experts , but also for the general public and disabled users .
The launch of this new website is scheduled for the second quarter of 2004 .
The ECB also practises openness in a literal sense , by welcoming visitor groups to its premises in Frankfurt .
In 2003 more than 7,000 visitors received first-hand information in the form of lectures and presentations given by ECB staff .
Students of economics and other social sciences make up the majority of visitors .
3 C O M M U N I C AT I O N I S S U E S I N 2 0 0 3 Among the most important communication issues in 2003 were : -- The evaluation of the monetary policy strategy .
The Governing Council confirmed the monetary policy strategy and clarified some of its elements ( see Section 1 of Chapter 1 ) .
-- The monetary policy stance ( see Section 2 of Chapter 1 ) .
-- The Governing Council 's view on fiscal developments in the euro area ( see Section 2 of Chapter 1 ) .
-- Monetary policy operations .
Following a public consultation procedure , a number of changes to the operational framework were adopted to take effect in the first quarter of 2004 ( see Section 1 of Chapter 2 ) .
-- Counterfeiting of euro banknotes .
The ECB continued to regularly inform the public of developments in the area of euro counterfeits ( see Section 3 of Chapter 2 ) .
-- The ECB 's view on the draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe ( see Section 1 of Chapter 4 ) .
-- Supervisory issues and financial stability , in particular the ECB 's participation in the preparations for the introduction of the New Basel Capital Accord (" Basel II ") ( see Chapter 3 ) .
-- The Governing Council 's policy position on exchange rate issues relating to the acceding countries ( see Section 1 of Chapter 7 ) .
-- Cooperation with the central banks of the acceding countries and development of working relationships with the media in those countries ( see Chapter 7 ) .
-- Development of new and improved money and banking statistics ( see Chapter 2 ) .
-- Organisational matters of the ECB , in particular the preparations for the ECB 's future premises as well as the efforts to strengthen the functioning of its internal organisation ( see Box 12 and Section 2 of Chapter 8 ) .
Box 12
THE ECB' S MISSION STATEMENT In August 2003 the Executive Board adopted the ECB 's mission statement .
It is regarded as fundamental in both the internal and external communication of the ECB .
Its adoption should be seen as part of the efforts to strengthen the functioning of the ECB 's internal organisation ( see Section 2 of Chapter 8 ) .
The mission statement reads as follows :
Â« The European Central Bank and the national central banks together constitute the Eurosystem , the central banking system of the euro area .
The main objective of the Eurosystem is to maintain price stability : safeguarding the value of the euro .
We at the European Central Bank are committed to performing all central bank tasks entrusted to us effectively .
In so doing , we strive for the highest level of integrity , competence , efficiency and transparency ."
In four short sentences the mission statement captures the Â« what , why and how Â» of the ECB .
The first sentence recognises the ECB 's vital relationship with the NCBs of the euro area .
The second sentence emphasises the primary objective assigned to the Eurosystem by the Treaty .
In addition to this primary objective , the ECB also carries out a wide range of other tasks and activities in the pursuit of its mandate , as reflected in the third sentence .
The fourth and final sentence illustrates the values which the staff and management of the ECB regard as important for the performance of their duties .
In a survey , the staff of the ECB were given the opportunity to influence the choice of values which should be given particular prominence . All staff members were asked to rank a number of values according to their importance for the work of the ECB .
The results of this survey served as direct input for the formulation of the mission statement .

ENLARGEMENT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
The ten acceding countries -- the Czech Republic , Estonia , Cyprus , Latvia , Lithuania , Hungary , Malta , Poland , Slovenia and Slovakia -- and the 15 current EU Member States signed the Accession Treaty at the informal European Council meeting in Athens on 16 April 2003 .
Two additional countries -- Bulgaria and Romania -- have not yet concluded accession negotiations but were given the prospect of joining the EU in 2007 .
1 The Accession Treaty sets out the framework and conditions for enlarging the EU to 25 Member States .
All the current and new Member States have ratified the Treaty .
As part of the ratification process , all of the acceding countries except Cyprus held public referendums : these nine countries voted in favour of joining the EU , eight of them by a large majority .
Upon accession , the ten countries will join EMU with the status of Â« Member States with a derogation Â» ( countries which have not yet adopted the euro ) and their central banks will become part of the ESCB .
Once these countries are deemed to have achieved sustainable convergence in compliance with the Maastricht convergence criteria 2 , they will adopt the euro and their central banks will become part of the Eurosystem .
In 2003 the Eurosystem continued to be involved in the accession process in all its areas of competence . It conducted policy and technical dialogues to help prepare the central banks of the acceding countries for integration into the ESCB and , subsequently , the Eurosystem .
As regards the policy dialogue , a number of bilateral contacts were made with the acceding country central banks to discuss monetary and exchange rate policies and other central banking issues .
The main aim was to try to enhance mutual understanding of the challenges ahead .
In addition , the ECB continued to be involved in the Â« Economic Dialogue Â» between the EU and the candidate countries 3 and , in November 2003 , it presented a report on macroeconomic and financial stability challenges in acceding countries to the Economic and Financial Committee .
Finally , in March 2004 a high-level seminar on the accession process was held in Paris with all ESCB and accession country central banks .
Among other topics , this seminar covered monetary and exchange rate policies and the practical functioning of the Exchange Rate Mechanism II ( ERM II ) .
As far as technical cooperation in 2003 was concerned , the Eurosystem intensified its support for the acceding country central banks to help them prepare for membership of the ESCB and the Eurosystem .
These activities focused primarily on statistics , legal issues , payment systems , monetary policy and operational issues , but also involved other areas of central banking , such as financial stability and supervision , banknotes , internal audit and information technology .
This chapter gives an overview of recent economic , financial and legal developments in the acceding countries and describes in more detail some of the accession-related preparatory activities carried out by the Eurosystem .
1 The term Â« accession countries Â» is used to refer to the ten acceding countries and Bulgaria and Romania . 2 See Article 121 ( 1 ) of the Treaty establishing the European Community .
3 The term Â« candidate countries Â» is used to refer to the 12 accession countries and Turkey .
1 KEY ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS AND POLICY ISSUES In 2003 the Eurosystem continued to monitor economic and financial developments in the acceding countries . The most relevant economic issues for the Eurosystem were inflation developments , monetary and exchange rate policies , economic growth and real convergence , balance of payments developments and fiscal policy .
The monitoring of financial markets included recent developments in both the banking sector and bond and stock markets .
wage-price spirals .
First , cyclical conditions are beginning to improve in some countries .
Second , temporary factors such as declining food prices are fading out .
Third , temporary inflationary pressures may also arise from accession-related factors , such as price deregulation , an adjustment of food prices as the acceding countries adopt the Common Agricultural Policy , and indirect tax adjustments required by EU law .
Finally , the catching-up process is likely to affect to some extent the inflation performance in the coming years as a result of the Â« Balassa-Samuelson effect Â» ( see Box 4 ) and wage pressures , the impact of which is likely to depend on the behaviour of nominal exchange rates .
MONETARY AND EXCHANGE RATE POLICIES The acceding countries maintain a variety of monetary policy strategies , reflecting the heterogeneity among them in nominal , real and structural terms .
Some countries with fixed exchange rate regimes have an exchange rate target in place , while other countries operate inflation-targeting frameworks or mixed strategies .
Two countries peg their currency unilaterally to the euro within a Â± 15 % fluctuation band .
During 2003 exchange rate regimes in the acceding countries remained unchanged , although some refinements were made to the monetary policy frameworks of several acceding countries , mostly with a view to gearing monetary policy more towards future monetary integration .
Monetary and exchange rate strategies in place made a significant contribution to macroeconomic stabilisation in the acceding countries by providing a credible anchor for inflation expectations , taking into account the high degree of openness that most of these countries display . More recently , however , some countries with more flexible exchange rate arrangements have experienced an increase in nominal exchange rate volatility .
These developments reflected a number of factors , including changes in investor sentiment following new macroeconomic and fiscal developments and , in some cases , possibly ECB Annual Report 2003 1.1 ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS INFLATION Inflation rates in the acceding countries have fallen remarkably quickly in recent years .
Average inflation has now fallen from doubledigit rates at the end of the 1990s to a level close to that of the euro area . In early 2003 average inflation was even below the euro area level .
Towards the end of 2003 a pick-up in inflation rates to slightly above euro area levels was recorded .
However , progress with disinflation continued to vary across individual countries .
While some countries recorded very low inflation and , in a few cases , even temporary decreases in general price levels , the disinflation process is not yet complete in others .
The strong general decline in inflation rates was largely the result of policy frameworks with a clear focus on fighting inflation .
However , temporary factors also played an important role , in particular cyclical developments , the lagged effects of strong exchange rate appreciation against the euro , some easing of energy prices and a decline in food prices .
Alongside diminishing inflationary pressures , policy interest rates continued to decline in most acceding countries in 2003 .
It will , however , be a real challenge to keep inflation at such low levels .
Several factors could lead to higher inflationary pressures , which in turn would make the economies vulnerable to rising inflation expectations and
external shocks . High exchange rate volatility may complicate monetary policy , have adverse effects on trade and make it more difficult to assess equilibrium exchange rates .
When the new Member States join the EU , they will be required to treat their exchange rate policies as a matter of common interest and to pursue price stability as the primary objective of monetary policy .
Moreover , they will be expected to join ERM II at some point in time .
Although ERM II can accommodate different exchange rate regimes , it is not compatible with free floating ( or managed floats without a mutually agreed central rate ) , crawling pegs or pegs against anchors other than the euro .
This means that , in some cases , exchange rate policy frameworks must be brought into line with the features of the mechanism .
Several acceding countries are currently reviewing their monetary and exchange rate strategies in the light of future participation in ERM II .
On 18 December 2003 the ECB published a policy position of the Governing Council on exchange rate issues relating to the acceding countries . This position aims to help to guide the process of monetary integration in the prospective Member States .
ECONOMIC GROWTH AND REAL CONVERGENCE In an environment of slow global growth , economic growth showed significant resilience in most acceding countries in 2003 , with real GDP growth projected to be around 3.5% on average .
Output developments were particularly strong in the Baltic States , and Poland , the largest acceding country , experienced a solid economic recovery after two years of low growth .
The key engine of growth in most acceding countries was strong domestic demand , fuelled in some countries by fiscal loosening and strong increases in wages .
In most acceding countries real export growth moderated but still displayed robust momentum considering the weak global environment and the countries Â» strong trade integration with the euro area . In some countries the contribution of
net exports to real GDP growth actually increased considerably .
At present , the GDP-per-capita gap with the current EU Member States is still large for most acceding countries .
Expressed in purchasing power parity terms , the acceding countries Â» estimated per capita GDP stood on average at around 49 % of the EU average in 2002 . In terms of nominal exchange rates , however , it reached only 26 % on average .
Moreover , real convergence in income levels with the EU is a gradual process , with growth differentials between the acceding countries and the current EU Member States usually having been in the range of around 2 percentage points in the past few years .
In the years to come , a key challenge for acceding countries will be to advance real convergence without putting current achievements in terms of macroeconomic stability at risk .
For most acceding countries , an average medium-term growth rate of between 4 % and 6 % seems within reach , provided that structural reforms proceed and stabilityoriented policies are kept in place .
Real GDP growth is expected to rise as a number of growth-enhancing factors increasingly come into play , in particular EU accession .
Although structural changes and high investment will be conducive to growth , they might also imply increased output volatility , especially as investment tends to be more cyclical than consumption .
This factor will therefore continue to pose challenges for policy-makers .
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS DEVELOPMENTS Real convergence was accompanied by sizeable current account deficits in most acceding countries .
The average current account deficit for the ten countries is estimated to have been around 3.9% of GDP in 2003 , with deficits being particularly high in some of the smaller countries . To the extent that the widening of the current account deficit reflects savings and investment decisions based on incorrect perceptions of economic conditions -- for
ECB Annual Report 2003 example , an overestimation of potential output growth or an underestimation of the probability of adverse shocks -- the sustainability of the external position may come under pressure in the medium to longer term and external vulnerabilities may increase .
Up to now , empirical findings have suggested that most of the acceding countries do not face major competitiveness problems .
Despite the global economic slowdown , most countries have witnessed sustained rates of export growth over the past few years and , in many cases , have enlarged their market shares in the EU .
Looking ahead , risks to external competitiveness could arise if countries were to be confronted with strong pressure to align their wage and price levels too quickly with those of the EU .
Moreover , an inappropriate mix of loose fiscal policy and tight monetary policy could trigger a strong , albeit temporary , appreciation of the currency .
Potential risks to current account sustainability relate also to possible future changes in the financing pattern .
Although capital inflows are generally expected to contribute to real convergence -- for example , through imported technology and management skills -- they might imply some destabilising effects .
This would be the case if the scale and nature of capital flows were to change substantially from the current pattern where net foreign direct investment ( FDI ) inflows essentially cover the current account deficits in many countries .
Following the end of the privatisation process in most of the acceding countries , a potential slowdown in FDI inflows might pose a challenge within this context , although EU accession may boost greenfield FDI inflows , i.e. investments in new projects , which may well compensate for diminishing privatisation-related FDI .
Managing highly volatile capital flows might become even more challenging as macroeconomic policies focus increasingly on preparing the ground for ERM II and , subsequently , the adoption of the euro .
Furthermore , capital flows largely in excess of the countries Â» absorption capacity could lead to overheating and more accentuated output volatility .
FISCAL DEVELOPMENTS Despite the recent pick-up in economic activity , fiscal deficits in the acceding countries remained on average at high levels in 2003 : in the order of 5 % of GDP for the ten countries as a whole .
At the same time , fiscal performance continued to vary across countries .
In most acceding countries fiscal deficits are largely of a structural nature , while the strength of automatic stabilisers ( the automatic reactions of the budget to economic fluctuations ) seems to be limited .
To consolidate the fiscal situation , the acceding countries will need to further reform their public expenditure and revenue structures in a sustainable and forward-looking manner .
Although the average debt level is comparatively low in the acceding countries , running continuously high deficits at a time when privatisation receipts are coming to an end could trigger unfavourable public debt dynamics , with possible repercussions for capital flows and exchange rate developments .
Moreover , implicit fiscal liabilities related to the ageing of societies might pose an additional challenge , at least for some of the acceding countries .
Fiscal consolidation is all the more challenging as the acceding countries will be confronted with expenditure pressures in the coming years . These will arise as a result of the completion of the transition process , contributions to the EU budget , the continuing implementation of the acquis communautaire and budgetary requirements related to NATO membership .
Moreover , forthcoming reforms of health and pension systems , as well as public investments during the catching-up process , may have an important bearing on fiscal accounts in the acceding countries .
At the same time , the implementation of the EU competition laws may lead to cuts in selected subsidies , which may alleviate some of the fiscal strain .
Upon EU accession , the new Member States will be subject to the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact that apply to all EU Member States , including the requirements to avoid excessive fiscal deficits and to aim for ECB Annual Report 2003 159
budgetary positions that are close to balance or in surplus over the medium term . A credible fiscal consolidation path is also needed in view of the prospective future monetary integration of acceding countries .
While entry into ERM II is not subject to a set of pre-established criteria , to ensure smooth participation in the mechanism , major policy adjustments should be made before countries join and a credible fiscal consolidation path followed .
1.2 FINANCIAL MARKET DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ACCEDING COUNTRIES BANKING SECTOR Most financial markets in the acceding countries are shallow , reflecting the size of these economies and the low stock of credit and deposits .
While financial markets in the acceding countries are largely dominated by the banking sector , the degree of financial intermediation ( the role of banks as intermediaries in channelling funds from depositors to borrowers ) is still rather low .
This is not , however , the case in Cyprus and Malta as these countries did not have to undergo a transition from a centrally planned economy to a market economy .
In the acceding countries of central and eastern Europe , the level of financial intermediation amounts to only one-third of the euro area average and is lower than in emerging market economies with comparable income levels .
This is largely because of i ) the initial conditions of the transition process , ii ) the disruptive effects brought about by banking crises in the early 1990s in these countries , iii ) the relatively short track record of domestic enterprises , which translates into heavy reliance on financing coming from own sources , and iv ) large FDI inflows into some countries .
Nevertheless , despite their limited size , banking sectors in the acceding countries appear to be relatively consolidated and sound , with an overall satisfactory level of capitalisation , profitability and asset quality .
Moreover , the bulk of the banking sector in the acceding
countries is foreign-owned : at the end of 2002 , foreign ownership of the banking sector in the acceding countries ( excluding Cyprus and Malta ) amounted to around 70 % of registered capital and 80 % of total assets .
4 Restructuring and consolidation in the banking sector through privatisation and opening up to foreign ownership have contributed to the soundness of the sector by increasing capital and funding and enhancing technology , governance and risk management expertise .
Nevertheless , some acceding countries still have sizeable nonperforming loans , even if these are on a declining trend and provisions against related risks appear to be relatively good .
Moreover , the foreign-currency exposure of the enterprise sector is comparatively high in some countries .
If the domestic currency were to weaken substantially in any of these countries , credit risks for the banking sector could emerge , which could in turn have implications for the conduct of monetary and exchange rate policies .
As the catching-up process to higher income levels proceeds , the main challenge for policymakers will be to manage the deepening of financial intermediation and a dynamic expansion of financial institutions Â» activities without risking the stability of the sector or the economy as a whole .
For example , it is likely that domestic enterprises will rely increasingly on external sources of finance , rather than on internal funds .
Likewise , as their income prospects and creditworthiness improve , households may increasingly engage in intertemporal consumption smoothing .
In most acceding countries financial intermediation has grown substantially in recent years , albeit starting from a very low base .
In 2002 and 2003 credit growth to private firms and households was particularly strong in Cyprus , Hungary , Slovakia and the three Baltic States .
Loans to households grew particularly quickly , outpacing the overall credit growth rate .
Regarding the distribution of loans among economic activities , 4 Latvia and Slovenia stand out in this respect , as foreign ownership of the banking sectors in these countries is considerably below the average .
mortgage loans are one of the fastest growing credit segments , having taken off from negligible levels . In 2002 and early 2003 mortgage lending growth was particularly strong in Hungary , Latvia and Poland .
Although the stock of credit remains low in most acceding countries , and much of it is secured by mortgages , the rapid deepening of financial intermediation and the expansion of financial sector balance sheets may entail higher volatility in financial performance both in individual financial institutions and the sector as a whole .
This highlights the need to maintain a credible and well-run prudential supervision and regulatory framework in acceding countries and calls , with regard to the financial sector structure , for greater cooperation between home supervisors and those responsible for supervising foreign parent banks .
BOND AND STOCK MARKETS The size of bond markets differs across acceding countries , while government is the main issuer of debt securities in most of the countries .
The stock markets of most acceding countries are relatively small , particularly in international terms , and the information and research coverage of these markets is selective .
Compared with key emerging markets , such as Brazil , Russia or Turkey , external debt markets are small in all the acceding countries except Poland .
Foreign debt levels differ across countries and in some countries -- such as Estonia and Latvia -- there is a substantial difference between net and gross debt levels .
An acceleration of debt dynamics was also observed in some countries .
In this context , the bond markets are the segment that has developed most over the past few years , especially in the Czech Republic , Hungary and Poland .
Macroeconomic stabilisation -- in particular , disinflation and lower interest rates -- and the prospect of EU membership have helped to reduce country risk and attract investors , resulting in a significant fall in long-term yields on domestic bonds in most of the acceding countries .
However , in the second half of 2003 , increasing concerns about the course of fiscal policies and overall policy consistency in some countries led to a reversal of some of the compression in yield spreads vis-Ã -vis the euro area witnessed in previous periods .
Yields of acceding countries Â» sovereign bonds denominated in key currencies remained at low levels .
Yield compression vis-Ã -vis the euro area was partly due to the global emerging market bond rally , although the prospect of EU membership , together with the improvement of sovereign ratings , also appears to have lowered spreads .
More generally , the acceding countries seem to have disconnected themselves from developments in other emerging markets .
The benevolent effects of EU membership should continue to play a key role in macroeconomic and structural developments in this respect .
However , conclusions about yield developments should be drawn with caution since many acceding countries have rather illiquid bond markets .
Stock markets in the acceding countries performed , on average , favourably in 2003 and broadly in line with stock markets in other emerging market regions , while outperforming euro area stock markets .
The stock markets in Latvia and Lithuania performed particularly strongly , with share prices roughly doubling during 2003 .
In Estonia and many central European acceding countries , stock markets also recorded solid gains .
However , in a few countries , stock exchanges recorded a less favourable performance in 2003 : in Cyprus stock prices fell , and in Malta the gains were only relatively moderate .

2 LEGAL DEVELOPMENTS The Eurosystem has a crucial interest in ensuring that acceding countries adopt and implement in time the parts of the acquis communautaire ( the body of EU law ) that relate to its fields of competence .
This refers to the Treaty and ESCB Statute provisions on central banks , and in particular central bank independence , as well as EU legislation in the financial field .
In 2003 the Eurosystem worked closely with the acceding country central banks ( ACCBs ) to analyse the level of compliance with these requirements .
As regards central bank independence , the statutes of the ACCBs were analysed on the basis of the criteria -- institutional , personal , functional and financial independence -- defined in the legal convergence reports prepared by the EMI and the ECB .
The analysis was also conducted in the light of EMI and ECB opinions on draft national legislation in their field of competence and , in particular , on the draft statutes of the NCBs of the EU Member States .
These opinions have helped the acceding countries to revise their central bank acts to comply with the Treaty requirements , thus laying the foundations for independent institutions .
Central banks and financial institutions must operate within a sound legal environment .
The acquis communautaire includes important rules for the financial sector and central banking activities .
It is crucial for the new Member States to comply with these rules as soon as they join the EU ( except where the Accession Treaty provides for transitional arrangements ) .
This is why the Eurosystem 's analysis also focused on legislation in the financial field , especially in the areas of freedom of movement of capital , prohibition on monetary financing and privileged access , regulation of the financial markets , collateral , payment systems , insolvency and banknotes .
The analysis gave an overview of the laws enacted and legislative drafts that had been presented for adoption to the respective national parliaments by 1 October 2003 .
Movement towards central bank independence has started in all of the acceding countries and in most of them it has been completed or is well advanced .
In some cases , where the wording of the national act was not yet fully in line with that of the Statute , the analysis suggested further adaptation of the national act .
The implementation of the acquis in the Eurosystem-relevant areas will take place , at the latest , when these countries join the EU , subject to any agreed transitional arrangements .
The results of this analysis were presented to the ACCBs and to the EU Council and the European Commission .
This analysis was not part of an assessment leading to the adoption of the convergence reports for the new Member States , which the ECB will have to prepare under Article 122 ( 2 ) of the Treaty .
Its purpose was to provide background information on the preparations for implementing the Eurosystem 's legal regime in the acceding countries , which are to join EMU as Member States with a derogation .
In addition , it helped the ACCBs to better define their role in the accession process at the national level . It has also helped the Commission in further strengthening the in-depth analysis of issues relating to central bank independence .
162 ECB Annual Report 2003
3 P R E PA R AT I O N S F O R A C C E S S I O N In 2003 the Eurosystem intensified its multilateral and bilateral cooperation with the acceding countries .
Since May 2003 the governors of the ACCBs have been attending the meetings of the General Council as observers and ACCB experts have also participated as observers in meetings of ESCB committees and working groups ( see Section 1 of Chapter 8 ) .
This has made it much easier for all parties to carry out detailed work on a wide range of enlargement-related issues .
In addition , technical consultations were held regularly and a comprehensive programme of visits was implemented for senior experts from ACCBs .
In general , preparations for EU enlargement are on track , which should enable the ACCBs to integrate smoothly into the ESCB as planned .
In 2003 the ECB set out an Accession Master Plan with a view to guiding the planning , implementation and monitoring of all ECB activities for ESCB and Eurosystem enlargement .
The Master Plan was inspired by the EMI Master Plan , which had laid down the organisational and logistical framework necessary for the ESCB to perform its tasks in Stage Three of EMU .
Regular monitoring ensures that all relevant issues are dealt with in a timely manner . This will enable the ACCBs to integrate smoothly into the ESCB framework without affecting the overall operational integrity of the ESCB 's systems .
Regular updates of the Master Plan are communicated throughout the ESCB and to the ACCBs .
All activities are being implemented according to the Plan .
As regards eligible assets for the Eurosystem 's credit operations , certain assets listed only in acceding countries will be included in the list of eligible assets from the day the ACCBs join the ESCB . Therefore , from May 2004 , the ACCBs will start performing the collateral management functions of identification , assessment and reporting of eligible assets .
In preparation , the ECB organised a workshop for acceding countries on these functions in November 2003 .
The ESCB studied in detail the operational functioning of an enlarged ERM II . In February 2004 it held a workshop for acceding countries on related aspects .
This preparatory work , together with testing to be conducted in spring 2004 , should guarantee the smooth operational functioning of ERM II .
In addition to the areas affected by ESCB enlargement , significant steps were also taken in operational areas related to Eurosystem enlargement .
For example , studies were launched on the implications of enlargement for monetary policy implementation and the management of the ECB 's foreign reserves .
3.2 PAYMENT AND SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS In 2003 the ECB defined the modalities for integrating the acceding countries into TARGET , essentially offering them the possibility of connecting to TARGET when they join the EU .
However , most acceding countries only plan to join the system when they adopt the euro .
Work has also been carried out on developing a fall-back solution to be used if the shared platform of TARGET2 ( see Section 2.2 of Chapter 2 ) is not available when the first acceding countries join the euro area .
As a follow-up to the 2002 assessment of the safety and efficiency of market infrastructures and the related oversight functions , ACCBs reported on the progress they had made in 2003 in implementing the ECB 's general and countryspecific recommendations . Substantial progress has been made and the ACCBs are continuing ECB Annual Report 2003
their efforts to complete outstanding issues , where necessary , in close cooperation with other national parties concerned . The ECB also organised a series of workshops for the ACCBs aimed at providing assistance in the preparations for accession to the EU and , subsequently , the euro area .
One workshop in Warsaw focused on the preliminary results of work carried out jointly by the ESCB and the Committee of European Securities Regulators on standards for EU securities clearing and settlement systems .
Another workshop in Prague addressed the collateral framework of the Eurosystem with a view to enabling the ACCBs to adjust to the key features of this framework as soon as possible .
And a third workshop in Ljubljana examined cost , benefit and risk issues relating to central counterparty clearing .
Furthermore , the Â« Repo conference for central banks -- the landscape of the European market Â» held in Rome focused on recent developments as well as requirements for the establishment of an efficient and integrated repo market , particularly in the light of EU enlargement .
All these events were organised by the ECB in cooperation with the local central bank .
Moreover , during 2003 the Eurosystem helped the ACCBs to carry out self-assessments of their securities clearing and settlement systems against the Â« Standards for the use of EU securities settlement systems in ESCB credit operations Â» .
These standards have provided the necessary framework for the efficient and safe execution of central bank credit operations ( see Section 4.3 of Chapter 3 ) .
The objective of the assessment was to identify , at an early stage , issues that needed to be addressed to ensure the smooth functioning of the Eurosystem credit operations .
A total of 20 securities settlement systems and one arrangement operated by an ACCB were assessed and a list of recommendations was produced for each system .
These recommendations will have to be implemented to make the system fully eligible for use in Eurosystem credit operations .
The ECB met for the fifth time with the Central and Eastern European Central Securities Depositories and Clearing Houses Association in October 2003 .
At this meeting the ECB provided information on a wide range of accession-related issues to representatives of ACCBs , securities regulators , central securities depositories and clearing houses .
The ECB and the European Payments Council , which was established by the European Credit Sector Associations and the major banks , organised a special workshop for selected ACCB representatives and their respective banking communities .
The purpose of this workshop , which was also attended by the European Commission , was to share important information on how to successfully integrate the acceding countries into the Single Euro Payments Area .
3.3 BANKNOTES In 2003 the ECB supported the ACCBs in establishing the infrastructure for handling euro counterfeits . The infrastructure must be in place when the acceding countries join the EU .
Moreover , in view of the long lead time for preparing the cash changeover in these countries after adoption of the euro , the ECB organised workshops for the ACCBs addressing , in particular , the arrangements for the issuance and handling of euro banknotes and the procurement of banknote launch requirements in the acceding countries .
3.4 STATISTICS At a high-level meeting in Copenhagen in October 2002 , the ministers for economics and finance from the EU Member States and the candidate countries invited the European Commission ( Eurostat ) and the ECB to provide an Action Plan for economic , monetary and financial statistics for candidate countries . This Action Plan was prepared and subsequently endorsed at a high -
ECB Annual Report 2003 level meeting with the candidate countries in May 2003 .
The participants noted that the completeness and timeliness of statistical information had been steadily improving .
However , the Action Plan also revealed that , unless major efforts were made in the run-up to accession , the acceding countries would not be in a position to meet all requirements , i.e. data timeliness , level of detail and other quality aspects .
The Action Plan puts emphasis on the supply of statistics required for the purpose of assessing convergence and on structural statistics .
It is made up of two main parts : the first part refers to statistics which fall under the responsibility of the European Commission ( Eurostat ) , namely annual national accounts , government deficit and debt , the HICP , structural indicators and short-term statistics .
Most action points aim at improving i ) the availability of statistics and conceptual compliance by May 2004 and ii ) compliance with EU statistical regulations in general .
The second part of the Action Plan covers issues under the responsibility of the ECB in the fields of balance of payments ( b.o.p. ) and international investment position ( i.i.p. ) statistics , money , banking and financial market statistics and quarterly financial accounts .
These statistics are mainly collected via the ACCBs .
The action points in this part aim at ensuring compliance with the requirements of the ESCB .
Both parts of the Action Plan are subject to regular review .
A high-level progress report drafted by the European Commission ( Eurostat ) and the ECB is to be published in mid-2004 .
In addition , the Executive Board of the ECB has set up a biannual progress review for the indicators for which the ECB has primary or shared responsibility .
are being enhanced to provide the necessary network and communications infrastructure .
The core network is the physical connection between the ESCB central banks for data and voice communication .
A new core network is being set up to connect all members of the enlarged ESCB .
The detailed technical design work for this network began in July 2003 .
In October 2003 the ECB started to implement a project to extend the ESCB-wide data communications infrastructure ( the Â« ESCBNet ") to the ACCBs .
The ESCB-Net is a data communications platform which hosts the majority of ESCB-wide applications . These include the applications required for supporting monetary policy , carrying out ECB foreign reserve operations , exchanging statistical and non-statistical data , and monitoring currency information .
The Â« ESCB Teleconference System Â» is also being extended to the ACCBs . New teleconference equipment is being installed to allow all current and new ESCB members to participate in teleconferences via the same secure infrastructure .
Preparations were also made for the significant enhancements to IT applications that are necessary for the enlargement of the ESCB and , subsequently , the Eurosystem . IT applications for the exchange of statistical data were updated .
The necessary changes to the application for combating euro counterfeiting are ongoing and will be completed before the ACCBs join the operational framework of the ESCB . 3.5 IT INFRASTRUCTURE AND APPLICATIONS Significant progress was made in 2003 in preparing the IT infrastructure and applications for ESCB enlargement .

EURO SYSTEM Governing Council Executive Board Nationale Bank van BelgiÃ« / Banque Nationale de Belgique Deutsche Bundesbank Bank of Greece Banca d' Italia Banque centrale du Luxembourg De Nederlandsche Bank Banco de EspaÃ±a Oesterreichische Nationalbank Banco de Portugal Banque de France Central Bank & Financial Services Authority of Ireland Suomen Pankki -- Finlands Bank Danmarks Nationalbank Sveriges Riksbank Bank of England á­¢ á­¢
The European System of Central Banks ( ESCB ) is composed of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) and the national central banks ( NCBs ) of all EU Member States ( currently 15 , 25 as of 1 May 2004 ) , i.e. it includes the NCBs of the Member States which have not yet adopted the euro .
In order to enhance transparency and facilitate understanding of the structure of central banking in the euro area , the Governing Council has adopted the term Â« Eurosystem Â» , which comprises the ECB and the NCBs of the Member States which have adopted the euro .
It was established as the core of the Eurosystem and the ESCB and ensures
European Central Bank ( ECB )
that their respective tasks are carried out either through its own activities or via the NCBs .
The euro area NCBs , which form an integral part of the Eurosystem , carry out the tasks conferred upon the Eurosystem in accordance with the rules established by the ECB 's decision-making bodies .
The NCBs also contribute to the work of the ESCB through their participation in the various ESCB committees ( see Section 1.5 of this chapter ) .
Decision-making within the Eurosystem and the ESCB is centralised .
However , in taking its decisions on the way in which the above tasks should be carried out , the ECB is committed to the principle of decentralisation in accordance with the Statute of the ESCB .
The General Council is constituted as a third decisionmaking body of the ECB , if and for as long as there are Member States which have not yet adopted the euro .
The functioning of the decision-making bodies is governed by the Treaty , the Statute of the ESCB and the relevant Rules of Procedure . 1
the Banca d' Italia in Rome and the other by the Banco de Portugal in Lisbon .
When taking decisions on monetary policy and on other tasks of the ECB and the Eurosystem , the members of the Governing Council do not act as national representatives , but in a fully independent personal capacity . This is reflected by the principle of Â« one member , one vote Â» applied within the Governing Council .
In December 2002 the Governing Council decided unanimously on the contents of its proposal on the future adjustment of its voting modalities , which will become necessary in the wake of future expansions of the euro area in an enlarged EU .
The proposal was made in accordance with the ECB Â« enabling clause Â» contained in the Treaty of Nice .
Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Nice on 1 February 2003 , the ECB formally adopted a recommendation on the adjustment of the voting modalities in the Governing Council .
The ECB recommendation was submitted to the EU Council in February 2003 .
On the basis of the recommendation , and after taking into account the opinions of the European Commission and the European Parliament , the EU Council , meeting in the composition of Heads of State or Government , unanimously adopted a Decision to amend Article 10.2 of the Statute of the ESCB ( voting modalities in the Governing Council ) on 21 March 2003 . In order to enter into force , this Decision needs to have been ratified by all Member States , which is not yet the case .
According to the Treaty , its main responsibilities are : -- to adopt the guidelines and take the decisions necessary to ensure the performance of the tasks entrusted to the Eurosystem ; and -- to formulate the monetary policy of the euro area , including , as appropriate , decisions relating to intermediate monetary objectives , key interest rates and the supply of reserves in the Eurosystem , and to establish the necessary guidelines for their implementation .
1 See Decision ECB / 2004/2 of 19 February 2004 adopting the Rules of Procedure of the European Central Bank , OJ L 80 , 18.3.2004 , p. 33 ;
Rules of Procedure of the General Council of the ECB , OJ L 75 , 20.3.1999 , p. 36 and L 156 , 23.6.1999 , p. 52 ;
Decision ECB / 1999/7 of 12 October 1999 concerning the Rules of Procedure of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank , OJ L 314 , 8.12.1999 , p. 34 .
These rules are also available on the ECB 's website .
According to this Decision , all members of the Governing Council will continue to attend meetings and participate in the deliberations .
However , the number of NCB governors holding a voting right at any one time will not exceed 15 .
The 15 voting rights will rotate among the governors according to preestablished rules .
The six members of the Executive Board will each maintain a permanent voting right .
In order to ensure that at any particular time the governors with a voting right are from countries which , taken together , are representative of the euro area economy as a whole , governors will hold a voting right with different frequencies . However , this differentiation between governors will apply exclusively to the prior determination of the frequency with which each governor has a voting right .
For all governors having a voting right at any point in time , the Â« one member , one vote Â» principle will apply .
Governors will be allocated to different groups , according to a ranking of the weight of the economies of their countries within the euro area , derived from an indicator which in addition to gross domestic product also reflects the size of their financial markets .
When the number of euro area countries exceeds 15 , there will be two such groups .
When there are 22 euro area countries , the system will be based on three groups .
The governors within each group will have a voting right for equal periods of time .
The new voting system is designed to be capable of accommodating any sequencing of euro area enlargement up to 27 countries , i.e. the current EU Member States and the 12 accession countries listed in the Declaration on the enlargement of the European Union annexed to the Treaty of Nice .
The rotation system will allow the Governing Council to maintain its capacity for timely and efficient decision-making while at the same time retaining the principle of ad personam participation of the members of the Governing Council and the Â« one member , one vote Â» principle .

1.4 THE GENERAL COUNCIL The General Council is composed of the President and the Vice-President of the ECB and the governors of the NCBs of all EU Member States . It carries out those tasks taken over from the European Monetary Institute which still have to be performed by the ECB on account of the fact that not all the Member States have adopted the euro .

The ESCB committees have continued to play an important role in the performance of the tasks of the Eurosystem / ESCB .
At the request of both the Governing Council and the Executive Board , the ESCB committees have provided expertise in their fields of competence and have facilitated the decision-making process .
Membership of the ESCB committees is usually restricted to staff of the Eurosystem central banks .
However , the NCBs of the Member States which have not yet adopted the euro take part in the meetings of an ESCB committee whenever it deals with matters that fall within the field of competence of the General Council .
Where appropriate , other competent bodies may also be invited , such as national supervisory authorities in the case of the Banking Supervision Committee .
Since the signing of the Accession Treaty in April 2003 , and in line with the decision to invite ACCB governors to participate in the meetings of the
General Council , experts from the ACCBs are invited to attend the meetings of ESCB committees in an observer capacity whenever they deal with matters that fall within the field of competence of the General Council .
At present there are 12 ESCB committees , all of which were established under Article 9 of the Rules of Procedure of the ECB .
The Budget Committee , which was established under Article 15 of the Rules of Procedure of the ECB , assists the Governing Council in matters related to the ECB 's budget .
1.6 CORPORATE GOVERNANCE In addition to the decision-making bodies , the corporate governance of the ECB also encompasses a number of external and internal control layers .
EXTERNAL CONTROL LAYERS The Statute of the ESCB provides for two layers , namely the external auditor , which audits the annual accounts of the ECB ( Article 27.1 of the Statute of the ESCB ) , and the European Court of Auditors , which examines the operational efficiency of the management of the ECB ( Article 27.2 ) .
In August 2002 the Governing Council decided that , in order to give the fullest public assurance as to the independence of the ECB 's external auditor , the principle of audit firm rotation should be applied .
This decision was implemented as part of the procedure for the appointment of the ECB 's external auditor ( under Article 27.1 of the Statute of the ESCB ) . The new external auditor commenced its duties in September 2003 .
2 The annual report of the European Court of Auditors , together with the ECB 's reply , is published on the ECB 's website and in the Official Journal of the European Union . INTERNAL CONTROL LAYERS In 2003 the ECB 's internal audit continued to perform audit missions under the responsibility of the Executive Board .
Its mandate is defined in the ECB Audit Charter . 3 The internal audit assesses and evaluates , on an ad hoc basis , the adequacy and effectiveness of the ECB 's system of internal control and the quality of the ECB 's performance in carrying out assigned responsibilities .
As endorsed by the Executive Board , the internal audit adheres to the International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing established by the Institute of Internal Auditors .
The Internal Auditors Committee , an ESCB committee established under a mandate from the Governing Council , is composed of the heads of internal audit at the ECB and the NCBs .
It is responsible for ensuring the coordination of audit coverage for joint projects and joint operational systems at the ESCB level .
The internal control structure of the ECB is based on a functional approach , whereby each organisational unit ( division , directorate or directorate general ) is responsible for its own internal control and efficiency .
In performing this task , organisational units implement a set of operational control procedures within their area of responsibility .
For example a set of rules and procedures -- known as a Chinese wall -- are in place to prevent inside information , for instance originating from the areas responsible for monetary policy implementation , from reaching the areas responsible for the management of the ECB 's foreign reserves and own funds portfolio .
In addition to these controls , the Directorate Planning and Controlling , the Risk Management Division and the Directorate Internal Audit advise and make proposals to the business areas and to the Executive Board on specific control issues affecting the organisation as a whole .
The members of the Governing Council adhere to a Code of Conduct , which reflects their responsibility to safeguard the integrity and reputation of the Eurosystem and to maintain the effectiveness of its operations .
4 The Governing Council has also appointed an adviser to provide guidance to its members on some aspects of professional conduct .
The Code of Conduct for the members of the Governing Council is comparable with the Code of Conduct of the European Central Bank , which gives guidance to , and sets benchmarks for , the staff of the ECB and the members of the 2 Following a tender procedure , KPMG Deutsche TreuhandGesellschaft AG WirtschaftsprÃ¼fungsgesellschaft was appointed as the ECB 's new external auditor with a f ive-year mandate .
The ECB Audit Charter is published on the ECB 's website to foster the transparency of audit arrangements in place at the ECB .
See the Code of Conduct for the members of the Governing Council , OJ C 123 , 24.5.2002 , p. 9 and the ECB 's website .
Executive Board , all of whom are expected to maintain high standards of professional ethics in the performance of their duties . 5 The ECB has detailed rules preventing the abuse of sensitive financial market information (" insider trading rules ") .
The staff of the ECB and the members of the Executive Board are thereby prohibited from taking advantage , whether directly or indirectly , of inside information to which they have access when conducting private financial activities at their own risk and for their own account , or at the risk and for the account of a third party .
6 An Ethics Adviser appointed by the Executive Board ensures a consistent interpretation of these rules .
ANTI-FRAUD MEASURES In 1999 the European Parliament and the EU Council adopted Regulation ( EC ) No 1073 / 1999 concerning investigations carried out by the European Anti-Fraud Office 7 (" OLAF Regulation ") in order to step up the fight against fraud , corruption and any other illegal activity detrimental to the Communities Â» financial interests .
It provides inter alia for the internal investigation of suspected fraud by OLAF within the Community institutions , bodies , offices and agencies .
While fully recognising and accepting the need for strong measures to prevent fraud , the Governing Council was of the view that the ECB 's independent position and statutory tasks precluded the application of the OLAF Regulation to the ECB .
Instead , it adopted the separate Decision ECB / 1999/5 of 7 October 1999 on fraud prevention , which provided for the establishment of a comprehensive anti-fraud scheme under the ultimate control of an independent Anti-Fraud Committee .
The creation of this independent committee enhanced the original layers of control within the ECB .
In 2003 the Anti-Fraud Committee held one meeting and was regularly informed by the Directorate Internal Audit of all issues related to the performance of its tasks .
The European Commission , supported by the Kingdom of the Netherlands , the European Parliament and the EU Council , subsequently challenged this stance ( Case C-11 / 00 ) .
The application of the OLAF Regulation should not impair the independent performance of the ECB 's tasks .
The ECB is now in the process of finalising a new Decision that will take full account of the judgement delivered by the Court .

2 O R G A N I S AT I O N A L D E V E L O P M E N T S 2.1 HUMAN RESOURCES STAFFING The total number of budgeted staff positions for 2003 was 1,271.5 full-time equivalent ( FTE ) positions .
At the end of 2003 the number of staff employed by the ECB was 1,217 ( 1,213.5 FTE positions ) , compared with 1,109 ( 1,105.5 FTE positions ) at the end of 2002 .
The average number of staff employed by the ECB in 2003 was 1,160 , compared with 1,080 in 2002 .
In 2003 151 new staff were recruited and 41 members of staff left the service of the ECB .
The number of FTE positions for 2004 has been set at 1,362.5 , representing a 7.1% increase over 2003 .
From 1 January 2003 all vacant positions were opened up to acceding country nationals .
The ECB successfully launched recruitment campaigns aimed specifically at recruiting such nationals as translators , lawyer-linguists and legal counsels .
39 staff members from acceding countries are currently employed on contracts for more than one year .
In 2003 90 experts from NCBs came to the ECB for short periods of approximately four months on average .
Of these experts , 48 came from ACCBs .
These short-term assignments proved particularly useful for both the ECB and the ACCBs in the preparations for the enlargement of the EU .
In 2003 the ECB offered 113 short-term contracts ( including extensions ) to replace staff on maternity , parental and unpaid leave , compared with 60 in 2002 .
The ECB provided traineeships to 166 students and graduates , mainly with an economics background , for an average duration of three to four months .
135 such traineeships were offered in 2002 .
In 2003 48 of the trainees were nationals of an acceding country .
Under the Research Visitors Programme , which focuses on specific high-level research projects in the field of monetary policy , 24 research visitors were welcomed in 2003 compared with 20 in 2002 ( see Section 5 of Chapter 2 ) .
The Graduate Research Programme , which is aimed at highly talented research students at an advanced stage of their doctoral studies , attracted 12 participants in 2003 , the same number as participated in 2002 .
INTERNAL MOBILITY In 2003 93 staff members changed jobs permanently after successfully applying for internal vacancies for permanent positions .
In addition , the ECB encouraged temporary internal mobility . 12 staff members took on another job for a limited period in order to gain work experience or to address an urgent but temporary business need , before returning to their previous position .
EXTERNAL MOBILITY At the beginning of the year the External Work Experience Scheme was introduced to support staff development .
In the framework of this scheme , staff may be seconded to NCBs and other relevant international and European institutions .
Three staff members participated in this scheme during 2003 for a period of two to five months .
CHILDCARE FACILITIES AND THE EUROPEAN SCHOOL The ECB childcare facilities have been enlarged by a third permanent facility offering approximately 90 additional places for the children of ECB staff .
This brings to 221 the total number of places available for children aged three months and above .
The secondary school of the European School Frankfurt opened in September 2003 with five grades .
Like the primary and pre-primary levels , the secondary school has four language sections : English , French , German and Italian .
2.2 MEASURES TO STRENGTHEN THE FUNCTIONING OF THE INTERNAL ORGANISATION Since 1998 the ECB 's priorities have been the establishment of its functions , the formulation and implementation of the single monetary policy and the introduction of the euro .
At the same time , however , the ECB has steadily grown , and the number of staff members substantially increased , creating a need to reinforce the functioning of its internal organisation .
Following the successful completion of the euro cash changeover , the Executive Board therefore decided to improve the organisational set-up , further develop the management structure and processes and reinforce human resources policies , in particular with regard to recruitment and career development .
ECB IN MOTION In the context of the increased focus on strengthening the internal organisation of the ECB , the Executive Board also decided , in early 2003 , to launch staff surveys on the issues of corporate principles , internal communication and organisational performance .
On the basis of the survey results , the Executive Board decided to embark on a process aimed at improving the functioning of the ECB called Â« ECB in Motion Â» .
The process , which involved staff to the largest extent possible , addressed the issues raised in the surveys .
Four project teams were established , under the guidance of a project office and the Executive Board .
The teams developed proposals regarding management , professional development , internal communication and measures aimed at reducing bureaucracy .
In October 2003 the Executive Board endorsed the bulk of the proposals made by the four project teams and set up a programme office that will oversee the further development and implementation of the measures endorsed .
Most of the approved ECB in Motion measures should be ready for implementation by July 2004 .
ESTABLISHMENT OF A MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE The Executive Board also reviewed its own functioning and its role in the management of the ECB . It decided to establish a Management Committee which will advise and assist the Executive Board with regard to the management of the ECB , its strategic planning and the annual budget process .
This will enable the Executive Board to increase the attention it devotes to the preparation and discussion of strategic issues , with regard to both the tasks and policies and the internal structure and functions of the ECB .
The Management Committee , which reports to the Executive Board , is chaired by a member of the Executive Board and composed of members of senior management .
The committee began its work in October 2003 .
RESTRUCTURING OF THE DIRECTORATE GENERAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS Since 1994 significant work has been devoted to establishing the core infrastructures and applications required for the start of Stage Three of EMU and the introduction of the euro .
During this time , the IT departments of both the EMI and the ECB have successfully met the deadlines set , and the information systems of the ECB and the ESCB have proven to be sound and robust .
At the beginning of 2002 the ECB decided to review the way in which information systems services are delivered at the ECB . The aim was to assess the existing organisation , structure and effectiveness of the ECB 's information systems delivery and to give guidance on its future direction .
In July 2003 the Executive Board approved four main recommendations which had been made in cooperation with an external consultant chosen to assist in the review .
These recommendations will result in the strategic redirection of information systems delivery and include the following measures : -- The project portfolio management , focusing on prioritisation and the allocation of IT and financial resources , will be strengthened .
179 -- The Directorate General Information Systems ( DG-IS ) has been reorganised in order to focus on enhancing project management and delivery capabilities .
Accordingly , the staff in DG-IS will concentrate more on in-house project management and delivery skills to cope with the growing IT project demand from the business areas of the ECB and from the ESCB .
-- The ECB will focus more on the establishment and enforcement of common IT architecture standards in order to reduce the complexity and maintenance costs of the IT landscape .
-- Finally , the ECB will reassess the sourcing options for the IT operational , support and infrastructure activities .
The new organisational structure is being established around three areas : an IT Projects Directorate , an IT Operations and Support Division and an IT Management Functions Division .
The implementation of the other recommendations has started and should be completed by the end of 2004 .
RESTRUCTURING OF THE DIRECTORATE GENERAL STATISTICS During 2003 a restructuring of the Directorate General Statistics ( DG-S ) took place .
Since the establishment of the ECB , the output and staff of DG-S had more than doubled , but the organisational structure had remained essentially the same .
The medium-term strategy for statistics , as adopted by the ECB in early 2003 ( see Section 4 of Chapter 2 ) , could only be implemented following an organisational review of the Directorate General .
This review started in February 2003 and was carried out by a team including an NCB expert .
Based on the team 's proposals , the Executive Board approved a new organisational structure , effective as of 1 February 2004 .
One of the main features of the reorganisation is the strengthening of the user-orientation of DG-S , e.g. through a centralised user information service .
Furthermore , the new set-up serves to increase efficiency and effectiveness in the development of new statistics and statistical standards by combining previously scattered positions allocated to these tasks in a separate new division .
2.3 NEW ECB PREMISES Being currently located in several different rented buildings , the ECB decided to have new premises built .
For this purpose it acquired a site , the Grossmarkthalle area , from the City of Frankfurt .
Within the framework of the Â« New ECB Premises Â» project , a worldwide call was issued for candidates to participate in the architectural design competition , with a deadline for applications of 20 January 2003 .
The ECB received applications from more than 300 architects from 31 nations and five continents .
In April a Pre-Selection Committee , consisting of five ECB experts supported by five architects , chose 80 candidates , 70 Â« established Â» and 10 Â« emerging young Â» architects .
All 80 candidates were invited to a question and answer session in Frankfurt am Main , which included a site visit to the Grossmarkthalle area .
Many of the questions raised by the architects related to the technical specifications of the old Grossmarkthalle building , which dates from 1928 , and to the requirements stemming from its status as a listed building .
The architects were then asked to anonymously submit a design proposal for the first phase by 7 July .
The competition was judged by an international jury chaired by the ECB 's Vice-President and consisting of 12 members : three members from the ECB , three members from NCBs , the five external , internationally renowned architects who had participated in the Pre-Selection Committee and one representative of the City of Frankfurt am Main .
On 28 and 29 August the jury shortlisted 12 candidates to be admitted to the second phase of the competition .
ECB Annual Report 2003 detailed architectural design concept by 12 December .
The jury chose the three prizewinning designs on 13 February 2004 .
8 All design proposals submitted in both phases of the competition were subsequently displayed to the public in a three-week exhibition at the Deutsches Architektur Museum in Frankfurt am Main .
The ECB may ask the prize-winning candidates to revise their design concepts in line with the recommendations of the jury and adjusted functional and technical requirements set by the ECB .
After examining and evaluating the final design concepts , the ECB will award the contract for the ECB 's new premises to the candidate who in the opinion of the ECB best meets the selection criteria .
The planning process will start thereafter and construction is scheduled to begin in 2006 .
8 A press release and pictures are available on the ECB 's website .
3 ESCB SOCIAL DIALOGUE In 2003 two meetings of the ESCB Social Dialogue were held , in which employee representatives from all the central banks of the ESCB and European trade union federations met with the ECB to discuss developments in the ESCB which have an impact on the situation of NCB employees .
Employee representatives of the ten ACCBs were invited to attend as observers .
As in previous years , the main items discussed were developments in banknotes , payment systems , and financial stability and supervision .
In the field of banknotes , the focus was on the arrangements for banknote printing in the long term ( see Section 3 of Chapter 2 ) .
Employee representatives argued that banknotes were a public good and highlighted that the quality and security of the banknotes were crucial for public confidence .
They also felt that the job security of printing works Â» staff should be safeguarded for various reasons , in particular in acknowledgement of the major efforts involved in having the euro banknotes printed in time for the cash changeover .
Therefore , central banks should continue to be involved in all processes related to banknotes , in particular their printing .
Regarding payment systems , the focus was on the progress in the preparations for TARGET2 ( see Section 2 of Chapter 2 ) .
The ECB informed the participants in the ESCB Social Dialogue on an ongoing basis of the progress made .
The employee representatives commented on the possible solutions and expressed a preference for a decentralised solution along the lines of the current system .
As regards financial stability and supervision , the ECB provided the participants with information on the reform of EU arrangements for financial regulation , supervision and stability , the process of implementation of the Lamfalussy framework in the banking sector , the process of revision by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision of the capital adequacy requirements for banks ( the New Basel Capital Accord ) , and reforms of national supervisory structures ( see Section 2 of Chapter 3 ) .
Employee representatives reiterated their preference for tasks relating to financial stability and supervision to be allocated to the central banks .
The ESCB Social Dialogue meetings also provided opportunities to discuss other more general issues such as the development of common training programmes and a corporate culture for the ESCB , the preparations of the ECB for the enlargement of the ESCB in 2004 and the restructuring in some NCBs following the establishment of the Eurosystem .
With regard to the latter issue , the factors underlying such reorganisations were discussed and the employee representatives expressed their concern about maintaining employment levels in the NCBs .
The views and concerns expressed by the trade union representatives were conveyed to the Governing Council and the General Council .
At the meetings of the ESCB Social Dialogue the ECB emphasised that the Governing Council , in taking its decisions , applies the principles of efficiency , effectiveness , security , high quality and high standards of service .
Furthermore , the impact of its decisions on employment and social conditions is taken into account .
In October 2003 the ECB launched an ESCB Social Dialogue Newsletter in order to enhance both the flow of information to the participants between meetings and the common understanding of the topics covered .
Finally , participants stressed the need to strengthen the corporate culture within the ESCB .
To this end common training programmes are being organised .

Frankfurt am Main , 9 March 2004 EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK Jean-Claude Trichet President
ACCOUNTING POLICIES1 FORM AND PRESENTATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The financial statements of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) have been designed to present fairly the financial position of the ECB and the results of its operations . They have been drawn up in accordance with the following accounting policies 2 , which the Governing Council of the ECB considers to be appropriate to the nature of central bank activity .
ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES The following accounting principles have been applied : economic reality and transparency , prudence , recognition of post-balance-sheet events , materiality , the accruals principle , going concern and consistency and comparability .
BASIS OF ACCOUNTING The accounts have been prepared on a historical cost basis , modified to include market valuation of marketable securities , gold and all other onbalance-sheet and off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency .
GOLD AND FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are converted into euro at the exchange rate prevailing on the balance sheet date .
Income and expenses are converted at the exchange rate prevailing at the time of the transaction .
The revaluation of foreign exchange assets and liabilities is performed on a currency-bycurrency basis , including on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet instruments . Revaluation to the market price for assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency is treated separately from the exchange rate revaluation .
No distinction is made between the price and currency revaluation differences for gold . Instead , a single gold valuation is 1 The detailed accounting policies of the ECB are laid down in a Decision of the Governing Council of the ECB of 5 December 2002 ( ECB / 2002/11 ) , OJ L 58 , 3.3.2003 , pp. 38-59 .
2 These policies are consistent with the provisions of Article 26.4 of the Statute of the ESCB , which require a harmonised approach to the rules governing the accounting and financial reporting of Eurosystem operations . accounted for on the basis of the price in euro per fine ounce of gold , which is derived from the exchange rate of the euro against the US dollar on 31 December 2003 .
SECURITIES All marketable debt securities and similar assets are valued at the mid-market prices prevailing at the balance sheet date on a security-by-security basis .
For the year ending 31 December 2003 , mid-market prices on 30 December 2003 were used .
INCOME RECOGNITION Income and expenses are recognised in the period in which they are earned or incurred .
Realised gains and losses arising from the sale of foreign exchange , gold and securities are taken to the profit and loss account .
Such realised gains and losses are calculated by reference to the average cost of the respective asset .
Unrealised losses in any one security , currency or in gold are not netted against unrealised gains in other securities , currencies or gold .
In the event of an unrealised loss on any item at the year-end , the average cost of that item is reduced to the year-end exchange rate and / or market price .
ECB Annual Report 2003 187
Premiums or discounts arising on purchased securities are calculated and presented as part of interest income and are amortised over the remaining life of the assets .
REVERSE TRANSACTIONS Under a repurchase agreement , securities are sold for cash with a simultaneous agreement to repurchase them at an agreed price on a set future date .
These agreements to repurchase are reflected on the liability side of the balance sheet and also lead to an interest expense in the profit and loss account .
Securities sold under such an agreement remain on the balance sheet of the ECB .
Under a reverse repurchase agreement securities are bought for cash with a simultaneous agreement to sell them back to the counterparty at an agreed price on a set future date .
These agreements to sell are recorded on the asset side of the balance sheet , but are not included in the ECB 's security holding and give rise to interest income in the profit and loss account .
Reverse transactions ( including security lending transactions ) conducted under an automated security lending programme are recorded on the balance sheet only where collateral is provided to the ECB in the form of cash over the maturity of the transaction .
In 2003 the ECB did not receive any collateral in the form of cash over the maturity of such transactions .
OFF-BALANCE-SHEET INSTRUMENTS Currency instruments , namely foreign exchange forward transactions , forward legs of foreign exchange swaps and other currency instruments involving an exchange of one currency for another at a future date , are included in the net foreign currency position for the purpose of calculating foreign exchange gains and losses .
Interest rate instruments are revalued on an item-by-item basis .
Outstanding interest rate futures positions are recorded in off-balancesheet accounts .
Since 2003 daily changes in the variation margin have been recorded in the profit and loss account .
POST-BALANCE-SHEET EVENTS Assets and liabilities are adjusted for events that occur between the annual balance sheet date and the date on which the Governing Council of the ECB approves the financial statements if such events materially affect the condition of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date .
INTRA-ESCB BALANCES / INTRA-EUROSYSTEM BALANCES Intra-ESCB transactions are cross-border transactions that occur between two EU central banks .
These transactions are processed primarily via TARGET -- the Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer system ( see Chapter 2 ) -- and give rise to bilateral balances in accounts held between those EU central banks connected to TARGET .
These bilateral balances are then assigned to the ECB on a daily basis , leaving each NCB with a single net bilateral position vis-Ã -vis the ECB only .
Intra-ESCB balances of the euro area NCBs with the ECB ( except for the capital of the ECB and positions resulting from the transfer of foreign reserve assets to the ECB ) are described as intra-Eurosystem claims or liabilities and are presented in the balance sheet of the ECB as a single net asset or liability position .
Intra-Eurosystem balances arising from the allocation of euro banknotes within the Eurosystem are included as a single net asset under Â« Claims related to the allocation of euro banknotes within the Eurosystem Â» ( see Â« Banknotes in circulation Â» in the notes on accounting policies ) .
Intra-ESCB balances of the non-euro area NCBs ( Danmarks Nationalbank , Sveriges Riksbank and the Bank of England ) with the ECB are disclosed under Â« Liabilities to noneuro area residents denominated in euro Â» .
TREATMENT OF FIXED ASSETS Fixed assets , with the exception of land , are valued at cost less depreciation . Land is valued
188 ECB Annual Report 2003
at cost . Depreciation is calculated on a straightline basis , beginning in the quarter after acquisition and continuing over the expected economic lifetime of the asset , namely : Computers , related hardware and software , and motor vehicles Equipment , furniture and plant in building Capitalised building and refurbishment expenditure Fixed assets costing less than Euros 10,000
4 years 10 years 25 years Written off in the year of acquisition
The depreciation period for capitalised building and refurbishment expenditure relating to the ECB 's existing premises has been reduced in order to ensure that these assets are completely written off by the end of 2008 , by which time the ECB is expected to have moved to its final location .
THE ECB' S RETIREMENT PLAN The ECB operates a defined contribution pension scheme .
The assets of the plan , which exist solely for the purpose of providing benefits for members of the plan and their dependants , are included in the other assets of the ECB and are identified separately in the notes on the balance sheet .
BANKNOTES IN CIRCULATION The ECB and the 12 euro area NCBs , which together comprise the Eurosystem , issue euro banknotes .
3 The total value of euro banknotes in circulation is allocated to the Eurosystem central banks on the last working day of each month in accordance with the banknote allocation key .
4 The ECB has been allocated a share of 8 % of the total value of euro banknotes in circulation , which is disclosed under the balance sheet liability item Â« Banknotes in circulation Â» .
The ECB 's share of the total euro banknote issue is backed by claims on the NCBs .
These claims , which bear interest5 , are disclosed under the sub-item Â« IntraEurosystem claims : claims related to the allocation of euro banknotes within the Eurosystem Â» ( see Â« Intra-ESCB balances / intra-Eurosystem balances Â» in the notes on accounting policies ) .
The Governing Council has decided that this income shall be distributed separately to the NCBs in the form of an interim distribution after the end of each quarter 6 .
It will be distributed in full unless the ECB 's net profit for the year is less than its income earned on euro banknotes in circulation , and subject to any decision by the Governing Council to reduce this income in respect of costs incurred by the ECB in connection with the issue and handling of euro banknotes .
OTHER ISSUES Taking account of the ECB 's role as a central bank , the Executive Board of the ECB considers that the publication of a cash flow statement would not provide the readers of the financial statements with any additional relevant information . In accordance with Article 27 of the Statute of the ESCB , and on the basis of a recommendation of the Governing Council of the ECB , the Council of the European Union has approved the appointment of KPMG Deutsche TreuhandGesellschaft Aktiengesellschaft WirtschaftsprÃ¼fungsgesellschaft as the external auditors of the ECB for a five-year period starting from the financial year 2003 .

NOTES ON THE BALANCE SHEET 1 GOLD AND GOLD RECEIVABLES The ECB holds 24.7 million ounces of fine gold ( 2002 : 24.7 million ounces ) .
No transactions in gold took place in 2003 .

The size and continuing requirement for this provision was reviewed annually , based on the ECB 's assessment of its future exposure to exchange rate and interest rate risk .
Given the significant depreciation of the US dollar vis-Ã -vis the euro in 2003 , this provision was used in full to cover unrealised losses expensed at year-end arising principally from the revaluation of the ECB 's holding of US dollar denominated assets ( see Â« Income recognition Â» in the notes on accounting policies and note 22 in the Â« Notes on the Profit and Loss Account ") 7 .

The first such adjustment following the establishment of the ECB was made on 1 January 2004 . On 1 May 2004 a second change of the ECB 's capital key will follow as a result of the accession of ten new Member States .
Based on the Council Decision of 15 July 2003 on the statistical data to be used for the determination of the key for subscription of the capital of the European Central Bank , the capital keys of NCBs were adjusted on 1 January 2004 as follows : From 1 January From 1 January 1999 to 31 2004 to 1 December 2003 May 2004 % % Nationale Bank van BelgiÃ« / Banque Nationale de Belgique Deutsche Bundesbank Bank of Greece

Under this agreement , reverse transactions conducted under repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements , each with a value of Euros 0.4 billion ( 2002 : Euros 1.4 billion ) , were outstanding as at 31 December 2003 ( see Â« Reverse transactions Â» in the notes on accounting policies ) .
Capital of the ECB Due to the overall reduction of 1.3559% in the weighting of the euro area NCBs ( with fully paid-up subscriptions ) in the ECB 's capital , and the increase in that of the non-euro area NCBs ( who only paid up 5 % of their subscription ) , the ECB 's capital decreased by a total of Euros 64 million on 1 January 2004 .
NCBs Â» claims equivalent to the foreign reserve assets transferred to the ECB Given the decrease in the weighting in the ECB capital key of the euro area NCBs ( which transferred foreign reserve assets to the ECB according to their prevailing subscribed shares in the ECB 's capital ) , the initial claim of Euros 40,497 million equivalent to this transfer was also adjusted accordingly .
Changes as at 1 May 2004 When the new countries join the European Union and their respective NCBs become part of the ESCB , the subscribed capital of the ECB and the limit on the amount of foreign reserve assets that may be transferred to the ECB will be increased automatically . 18 INTEREST RATE FUTURES In 2003 foreign currency interest rate futures were used within the management of the ECB 's foreign reserves .

C H R O N O L O G Y O F M O N E TA R Y P O L I C Y MEASURES OF THE EUROSYSTEM1 9 JANUARY 2003 The Governing Council of the ECB decides that the minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 2.75% , 3.75% and 1.75% respectively .
6 FEBRUARY 2003 The Governing Council of the ECB decides that the minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 2.75% , 3.75% and 1.75% respectively .
23 JANUARY 2003 The Governing Council of the ECB decides to implement the following two measures to improve the operational framework for monetary policy : First , the timing of the reserve maintenance period will be changed so that it will always start on the settlement day of the main refinancing operation ( MRO ) following the Governing Council meeting at which the monthly assessment of the monetary policy stance is pre-scheduled .
Second , the maturity of the MROs will be shortened from two weeks to one week .
6 MARCH 2003 The Governing Council of the ECB decides to lower the minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations by 0.25 percentage point to 2.50% , starting from the operation to be settled on 12 March 2003 .
It also decides to lower the interest rates on both the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility by 0.25 percentage point , to 3.50% and 1.50% respectively , both with effect from 7 March 2003 .
3 APRIL 2003 The Governing Council of the ECB decides that the minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 2.50% , 3.50% and 1.50% respectively .
8 MAY 2003 The Governing Council of the ECB decides that the minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 2.50% , 3.50% and 1.50% respectively .
1 The chronology of monetary policy measures of the Eurosystem taken in 1999 to 2001 can be found on pages 176 to 180 of the ECB 's Annual Report 1999 , on pages 205 to 208 of the ECB 's Annual Report 2000 and on pages 219 to 220 of the ECB 's Annual Report 2001 respectively .
It also announces the results of its evaluation of the ECB 's monetary policy strategy .
This strategy , which was announced on 13 October 1998 , consists of three main elements : a quantitative definition of price stability , a prominent role for money in the assessment of risks to price stability , and a broadly based assessment of the outlook for price developments .
The Governing Council confirms the definition of price stability formulated in October 1998 , namely that Â« price stability is defined as a yearon-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices ( HICP ) for the euro area of below 2 %.
Price stability is to be maintained over the medium term Â» .
At the same time , the Governing Council agrees that in the pursuit of price stability it will aim to maintain inflation rates close to 2 % over the medium term .
The Governing Council confirms that its monetary policy decisions will continue to be based on a comprehensive analysis of the risks to price stability .
At the same time , the Governing Council decides to clarify in its communication the respective roles played by economic and monetary analysis in the process of coming to the Council 's overall assessment of risks to price stability .
To underscore the longer-term nature of the reference value for monetary growth as a benchmark for the assessment of monetary developments , the Governing Council also decides that it will no longer conduct a review of the reference value on an annual basis .
However , it will continue to assess the underlying conditions and assumptions .
the interest rates on both the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility by 0.50 percentage point , to 3.0% and 1.0% respectively , both with effect from 6 June 2003 .
10 JULY , 31 JULY , 4 SEPTEMBER , 2 OCTOBER , 6 NOVEMBER , 4 DECEMBER 2003 AND 8 JANUARY 2004 The Governing Council of the ECB decides that the minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 2.0% , 3.0% and 1.0% respectively .
12 JANUARY 2004 The Governing Council of the ECB decides to increase the allotment amount for each of the longer-term refinancing operations to be conducted in the year 2004 from Euros 15 billion to Euros 25 billion .
This increased amount takes into consideration the higher liquidity needs of the euro area banking system anticipated for the year 2004 .
The Eurosystem will , however , continue to provide the bulk of liquidity through its main refinancing operations .
5 FEBRUARY , 4 MARCH 2004 The Governing Council of the ECB decides that the minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility will remain unchanged at 2.0% , 3.0% and 1.0% respectively .
5 JUNE 2003 The Governing Council of the ECB decides to lower the minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations by 0.50 percentage point to 2.0% , starting from the operation to be settled on 9 June 2003 .

Acceding countries : see Accession countries Accession countries : there are currently 13 countries in central and eastern Europe and in the Mediterranean which have been recognised by the European Council as candidates for accession to the European Union ( EU ) . Ten countries will join the EU on 1 May 2004 : the Czech Republic , Estonia , Cyprus , Latvia , Lithuania , Hungary , Malta , Poland , Slovenia and Slovakia .
Countries joining the EU must have implemented the existing acquis communautaire by the time of accession . Balance of payments ( b.o.p. ) : a statistical statement that summarises , for a specific time period , the economic transactions of an economy with the rest of the world .
The concepts and definitions used in the euro area balance of payments generally conform to the 5th edition of the IMF Balance of Payments Manual , to the related Guideline ECB / 2003/7 of 2 May 2003 and to Eurostat 's documentation . Basel Capital Accord : a regulatory framework setting out minimum capital requirements to ensure that banks are able to cover their risks .
This framework was adopted in 1988 by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision on which the central banks and other banking supervisory authorities from the G10 countries , Spain and Luxembourg are represented .
The Accord has evolved into a global standard and is now under review in order to adapt it to developments that have occurred in the financial sector since it was initially introduced (" New Basel Capital Accord Â» or Â« Basel II ") .
Benchmark portfolio : in relation to investments , a reference portfolio or index constructed on the basis of the objectives for the liquidity and risk of , as well as the return on , the investments .
The benchmark portfolio serves as a basis for comparison of the performance of the actual portfolio .
Bond market : the market on which medium and long-term debt securities , i.e. debt securities with an original maturity of more than one year , are issued and traded .
Broad Economic Policy Guidelines ( BEPGs ) : the Treaty obliges the Member States to regard their economic policies as a matter of common concern and to coordinate them within the EU Council . The BEPGs constitute the main instrument of this coordination .
They contain recommendations to policy-makers on macroeconomic and structural policies and provide a yardstick for ex post assessment in the context of multilateral surveillance within the EU Council .
The EU Council , acting on a recommendation from the European Commission , formulates a draft of the BEPGs and reports its findings to the European Council .
The EU Council then adopts a recommendation on the BEPGs based on the European Council 's conclusions .

9 November 2006 - Monthly Bulletin
At its meeting on 2 November 2006 , the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged .
The information that had become available since the Governing Council 's decision of 5 October to increase interest rates further underpinned the reasoning behind that decision .
It also confirmed that strong vigilance remains of the essence so as to ensure that medium to longer-term inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability .
With the key ECB interest rates at still low levels , money and credit growth dynamic , and liquidity ample by all plausible measures , the ECB 's monetary policy continues to be accommodative .
If the Governing Council 's assumptions and baseline scenario continue to be confirmed , it will remain warranted to further withdraw monetary accommodation .
Indeed , acting in a firm and timely manner remains essential to ensuring price stability over the medium term . As emphasised repeatedly , this is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area .
Turning first to the economic analysis , Eurostat 's second estimate confirmed that real GDP growth in the euro area was 0.9% quarter on quarter in the second quarter of 2006 , after 0.8% in the first quarter .
Looking through the usual volatility of quarterly growth rates , economic activity grew at an average quarter-on-quarter rate of 0.7% over the four quarters to mid-2006 , and thus faster than generally expected a year ago. On the basis of various monthly indicators of economic activity and confidence surveys , available up to October , the momentum of the economic expansion is expected to have continued in the second half of this year .
In addition , the unemployment rate has been declining , employment growth has recovered and employment expectations remain favourable .
All in all , the assessment of a more broadly based and more self-sustaining recovery continues to be confirmed by the incoming data , notwithstanding some possibility of a somewhat slower pace of quarter-on-quarter real GDP growth in the second half of this year than in the first .
Looking further ahead , the conditions remain in place for the euro area economy to grow at solid rates around potential , although some volatility in the quarterly growth rates is likely to emerge around the turn of the year , mainly reflecting the impact of an increase in indirect taxes in a large euro area country in January 2007 .
Global economic activity has become more balanced across regions and remains robust , thereby providing ongoing support for euro area exports .
Investment is expected to remain dynamic , benefiting from an extended period of very favourable financing conditions , balance sheet restructuring , accumulated and ongoing strong earnings , and gains in business efficiency .
Risks to the outlook for economic growth are broadly balanced over the shorter term , taking into account , in particular , the recent slowing down in the US economy on the one hand and the recent fall in oil prices on the other .
The oil price decline -- if it were to prove lasting -- has the potential to lead to somewhat stronger demand and output growth than embodied in the Governing Council 's current baseline scenario for activity in the coming quarters .
Over the longer term , risks to growth continue to lie on the downside , relating mainly to the possibility of a renewed increase in oil prices , fears of a rise in protectionist pressures , especially after the suspension of the Doha round of trade talks , and possible disorderly developments owing to global imbalances .
As regards price developments , according to Eurostat 's flash estimate annual HICP inflation was 1.6% in October , after having declined to 1.7% in September from 2.3% in August .
The recent decline in inflation is the combined result of favourable base effects , given in particular the strong rise in oil prices a year ago , and the recent significant fall in oil prices .
While the outlook for energy prices remains uncertain , on the basis of current energy prices and the higher quotations on futures markets , inflation rates are likely to increase again in the next few months and early 2007 .
As a consequence , the Governing Council expects a high degree of short-term volatility in the annual HICP inflation rate .
Looking through this volatility , however , HICP inflation will remain elevated at a level above 2 % on average in 2006 and is likely to remain so in 2007 .
Risks to the outlook for price stability remain clearly on the upside . They continue to include a stronger pass-through of past oil price rises into consumer prices than currently anticipated and additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those announced thus far .
Furthermore , renewed increases in oil prices cannot be excluded .
More fundamentally , given the favourable momentum of real GDP growth observed over the past few quarters and the ongoing improvement in labour markets , stronger than currently expected wage developments pose substantial upward risks to price stability .
Against this background , it is crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities , particularly in the context of a more favourable environment for economic activity and employment .
The monetary analysis continues to point to upside risks to price stability at medium to longer horizons .
Annual M3 growth rose again to 8.5% in September , after having increased to 8.2% in August .
Although the annual growth rate of M1 has moderated somewhat in recent months , reflecting shifts into instruments with more market-related returns in a context of rising interest rates , this has been more than compensated by the stronger expansion of the other components of M3 .
More generally , the rate of monetary and credit expansion remains rapid , reflecting the still low level of interest rates in the euro area and the strengthening of economic activity .
In particular , loans to the private sector continue to grow at double-digit rates on an annual basis , their dynamism remaining broadly based across the household and corporate sectors .
While the growth of household borrowing shows some signs of stabilisation , albeit at very high rates , the growth of borrowing by non-financial corporations continues to trend upwards and has now reached rates of over 12 % on an annual basis , the highest seen since the early 1990s .
Taking the appropriate medium-term perspective , the latest developments are consistent with a continuation of the persistent upward trend in the underlying rate of monetary expansion , identified by the ECB 's monetary analysis since mid-2004 .
Furthermore , following several years of robust monetary growth , the liquidity situation in the euro area is ample by all plausible measures .
Continued strong monetary and credit growth in an environment of ample liquidity point to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term .
Monetary developments therefore continue to require very careful monitoring , particularly against the background of improved economic conditions and strong property market developments in many parts of the euro area .
To sum up , annual inflation rates are projected to remain elevated in 2006 and 2007 , with risks to this outlook remaining clearly on the upside .
Given the ongoing marked dynamism of monetary growth in an environment of ample liquidity , a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium to longer term .
Acting in a firm and timely manner remains essential to ensuring price stability over the medium term .
The Governing Council will therefore exercise strong vigilance .
As regards fiscal policy , euro area countries have recently notified their deficit and debt figures for 2005 to the European Commission , and most have reported on developments in 2006 and budget plans for 2007 .
While , on average , this information points to further , albeit slow , improvements in budget balances , this should not give rise to complacency .
It is important that commitments under the revised Stability and Growth Pact are met in all euro area countries .
It is essential that budgetary consolidation is strengthened in the current economic upswing and that pro-cyclical policies are avoided . This would boost confidence among market participants and the public .
To that effect , any revenue windfalls from faster than expected growth should be pre-committed and used in full to speed up deficit reduction or to increase surpluses in good times .
The prospects for attaining sound budgetary positions improve when consolidation plans are based on credible commitments to reduce expenditure ratios and better expenditure control mechanisms .
Finally , the Governing Council reiterated previous calls for high-quality statistical data and sound statistical reporting , which are key for the prevention and correction of budgetary imbalances .
As regards structural reforms , the Governing Council stressed the importance of creating a fully operational Single Market and flexible product and labour markets in order to enhance the adjustment capacity of the euro area economy and its resilience to external shocks .
Liberalising product markets to allow more competition would raise incentives for firms to invest and innovate , thereby raising productivity growth .
Removing labour market rigidities and distortions in wage and price formation are key conditions for promoting more homogeneous cost and price competitiveness trends among euro area countries and for generating sustained output growth and job creation .
In particular , wage increases should be guided , in general , by the trend in labour productivity growth , while taking full account of the present level of unit labour costs , in order to preserve or restore price competitiveness .
Moreover , it is desirable that wage settlements move away from automatic , backward-looking indexation mechanisms .
The successful implementation of reforms aimed at removing rigidities and inefficiencies in euro area countries would raise potential growth and employment prospects .

EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK OPINION OF THE GOVERNING COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK of 24 April 2003 on a recommendation from the Council of the European Union on the appointment of a member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank ( CON / 2003/6 )
( 2003 / C 105/07 ) 1 .
By letter of 14 April 2003 , the President of the Council of the European Union requested the Governing Council of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) to deliver its opinion on Council Recommendation 2003/301 / EC of 14 April 2003 on the appointment of a member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank ( 1 ) .

C 344/4
EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK OPINION OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK of 16 November 2001 at the request of the Council of the European Union on a proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading ( COM ( 2001 ) 280 final ) ( CON / 2001/36 )
( 2001 / C 344/05 ) 1 .
On 5 July 2001 the European Central Bank ( ECB ) received a request from the Council of the European Union for an opinion on a proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading ( COM ( 2001 ) 280 final ) ( hereinafter referred to as the Â proposed Directive Â) .
The achievement of the primary objective of the Eurosystem , the maintenance of price stability , requires that monetary policy impulses be transmitted in a smooth way throughout the euro area by means of integrated and efficient financial markets .
Securities markets , together with the unsecured money market and the banking sector , play a key role in this respect .
The existence of some degree of segmentation of financial markets in the jurisdiction of a central bank is not an uncommon phenomenon .
However , obstacles to the integration of securities markets in the euro area may slow down or distort the transmission of monetary impulses to the economy . In addition , the Treaty states that without prejudice to the objective of price stability , the Eurosystem shall contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the Community .
A prominent objective of the Community is to achieve balanced and sustainable development , by establishing a common market .
In this respect , the introduction of a single currency is proving to be a powerful triggering event , leading towards easier access to borrowing and investment opportunities .
Ultimately , this will enhance the capacity of issuers to raise capital on an EU-wide basis , by reducing the cost of financing and improving the efficiency of the allocation of financial resources throughout the euro area .
Therefore , it is in the interest of the Eurosystem that obstacles to the integration of securities markets do not thwart the full benefits of EMU .
2 . The ECB 's competence to deliver an opinion is based on the first indent of Article 105 ( 4 ) , of the Treaty establishing the European Community ( hereinafter referred to as Â the Treaty Â) , since the proposed Directive constitutes an instrument essential to ensure the integrity of the Community financial markets and to enhance investor confidence in those markets and contains provisions with a bearing on the issuance of securities by the ECB .
The ECB also notes that Article 105 ( 1 ) of the Treaty and Article 2 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank state that the ESCB shall support the general economic policies in the Community .
In accordance with the first sentence of Article 17.5 of the Rules of Procedure of the ECB , this opinion has been adopted by the Governing Council of the ECB .
The main objective of the proposed Directive is the introduction of a single passport for issuers offering securities at European Union level .
It provides the possibility of offering securities or admitting securities to trading on the basis of a simple notification of the prospectus approved by the home competent authority .
In order to attain this objective , the proposed Directive introduces the necessary harmonisation of the rules applicable to public offer and of the information contained in a prospectus thus ensuring equivalent protection for investors at Community level . The disclosure standards introduced by the proposed Directive are in line with international standards regarding public offer of securities and admission to trading .
The ECB generally welcomes and supports the aims pursued by the proposed Directive , as the ECB sees the proposal as an effective means of advancing European financial markets integration . The Eurosystem has a keen
Generally , efficient and integrated securities markets can facilitate economic growth and reduce the cost of raising capital in the EU .
In addition , European securities markets will become more liquid , therefore attracting more investments and also more issuers from third countries .
The proposed Directive , with the introduction of a single passport for issuers , will improve market access for raising capital in the EU and eliminate existing obstacles to crossborder offering of securities .
On account of the new language regime for multinational offerings and admissions to trading costly translation will be significantly reduced .
Regulatory compliance will be simplified , since host Member States will be deprived of the possibility of requiring adherence to additional national rules .
As a consequence , raising capital should become easier and cheaper for companies of all sizes .
The introduction of harmonised and enhanced disclosure standards in line with international standards for public offer of securities
C 344/5
and admission to trading is likely to increase investor confidence , in particular as regards investing on an EU-wide basis .
However , a high level of disclosure has to be balanced against the need for an efficient issuance process , with costs proportional to the size of the issuing company and the type of security issued .
Standardised , easily available and regularly updated information will improve and widen the basis for well-founded decision making by investors .
The positive implications of the proposed Directive for both issuers and investors will enhance the ability of the financial markets to fulfil their function of efficient capital allocation , as they become more liquid and efficient .
Moreover , the ECB holds the view that the enhancement of issuer disclosure will favour selection by investors of new investment projects and reduce information asymmetry , leading in turn to greater market liquidity .
The ECB also notes that the abovementioned benefits are in principle a consequence of any enhancement in corporate disclosure .
In this respect , the ECB notes that the Lisbon European Council urged that steps be taken to enhance the quality and the comparability of corporate disclosure for listed companies , and that the Commission has already launched a number of new initiatives , which aim to build a new EU regime on disclosure requirements .
implementing measures subject procedure in one single article .
The ECB notes that Article 6 ( 2 ) of the proposed Directive refers to the work of the International Organisation of Securities Commissions ( IOSCO ) , by stating that rules concerning the information to be included in the prospectus , adopted by the Commission under comitology procedure , shall be in accordance with the information requirements set out by IOSCO , where it is possible and appropriate .
The ECB welcomes the aim of bringing European securities legislation in line with IOSCO standards .
The adoption of internationally accepted principles such as those enacted by IOSCO would lead to convergence of international financial systems towards a more harmonised securities disclosure regime .
The ECB also notes that Article 18 ( 1 ) of the proposed Directive stipulates conformity with IOSCO standards as a necessary requirement for the approval by a Member State of a prospectus drawn up for an offer or admission to trading in a third country .
The ECB welcomes the proposed introduction of a harmonised definition of public offer , which will avoid different interpretations of Community rules and ensure the same level of investor protection throughout the EU .
The ECB notes that Article 3 ( 2 ) of the proposed Directive defines offers to which the obligation of publishing a prospectus does not apply as offers either to qualified investors for their account , or to a restricted circle of persons , or concerning securities which can be acquired only for a consideration of at least EUR 150 000 per investor .
In this respect , the ECB welcomes the fact that clarification and adaptation of the exemptions are under comitology procedure in order to ensure the necessary degree of flexibility .
In addition , the ECB notes that the definition of qualified investors should also include the ECB and the central banks of the Member States .
The ECB welcomes the use of the comitology procedure in the proposed Directive , as recommended by the Committee of Wise Men . Following the endorsement by the resolution of the Stockholm European Council of March 2001 , the new approach aims to make the European Union securities legislation more effective and transparent , allowing adequate and timely response to dynamic market developments .
Generally , the ECB holds the view that the application of the comitology procedure to securities market regulation should take account of the advisory role that the Treaty confers on the ECB , by allowing for the incorporation of the ECB 's views in the regulatory process .
More specifically , as regards the proposed Directive , the ECB notes that for the sake of clarity as to the application of the procedure it may be advisable either to restate in Article 22 ( 2 ) the articles subject to the comitology procedure or , as a minimum , to assemble all 9 .
In addition , the ECB holds the view that greater clarity could be obtained regarding the coverage of the Directive if reference was made to existing international and European standards such as ESA95 .
This applies in particular to the definition of the term Â securities Â and the identification of the Â sector Â of the issuer .
While Article 2 of the proposed Directive defines the term Â securities Â, further elaboration is needed to obtain a common definition of securities that takes into account debt and equity securities .
A possible starting point could be the definitions used in ESA95 .
Finally , the ECB notes that the proposed Directive shall apply to issuers except inter alia Member States and certain international organisations .
Greater clarity would be desirable as to which economic entities are within the scope of the proposed Directive or conversely , to define which entities fall outside its scope .
The ECB welcomes the exclusion from the scope of the proposed Directive of securities issued by the ECB .
In this respect the ECB wants to underline that this exclusion is vital for the unhampered conduct of the single monetary policy of the Eurosystem .
The single monetary policy relies on a number of different instruments , inter alia ECB debt certificates , which might be issued with the aim of adjusting the structural position of the Eurosystem vis-Ã -vis the financial sector so as to create ( or enlarge ) a liquidity shortage in the market , in accordance with section 3.3 of the general documentation on Eurosystem monetary
C 344/6
policy instruments and procedures , November 2000 ( Annex 1 to Guideline ECB / 2000/7 of 31 August 2000 on monetary policy instruments and procedures of the Eurosystem ) ( 1 ) .
As the formulation and the implementation of the Eurosystem monetary policy lies within the exclusive competence of the ECB 's decision-making bodies , as laid down by the Treaty , the use of the instruments necessary to fulfil that task should be as smooth and unhampered by legal and operational obstacles as possible .
Consequently , the necessary degree of transparency of the conditions applicable to the securities issued by the Eurosystem will be ensured by the publication of the applicable legal documentation ( the aforementioned Guideline ECB / 2000/7 as well as the respective legal documentation of the national central banks ) .
Any additional formal requirements might compromise the necessity of the Eurosystem to react quickly and flexibly to financial market developments .
In the light of the abovementioned considerations , Article 1 of the proposed Directive should also exclude the national central banks from the scope of the Directive .
The ECB notes that Article 19 requires each Member State to designate the administrative authority competent to carry out the duties introduced by the proposed Directive , listing the powers given to the competent authority .
In the explanatory memorandum the Commission refers to the need to ensure the independence of the competent authorities , avoiding possible conflicts of interest .
The ECB notes that the avoidance of conflicts of interest will gain importance as more and more exchanges are transformed into for-profit entities while these exchanges remain entrusted with listing and certain Â public functions Â such as the formal approval of prospectuses .
Consequently , there is a need to find appropriate regulatory means to address and solve potential conflicts of interest resulting from the changing nature of the exchanges .
The ECB notes that it appears desirable to clarify in the proposed Directive the regime applicable to public offers of debt securities issued by credit institutions .
As regards such intermediaries , it must be taken into account that the raising of capital from the public by issuing debt instruments falls within their institutional activities , and that they are subject to public supervision and to specific transparency requirements in order to protect savings .
Therefore , it could be considered retaining the provision existing in the current Directive , which allows Member States to exempt credit institutions from the obligation to publish a prospectus when the latter are issuing debt securities or other transferable securities equivalent to debt securities in a continuous or repeated manner .
The ECB holds the view that the proposed Directive might envisage a broader scope for supervisory cooperation .
The proposed Directive refers solely to cooperation between the Â competent authority Â of the home and the host Member States in the field of supervision as defined by the proposed Directive , and in particular , it does not foresee the possibility or obligation of cooperation between the competent authorities in the field of supervision under the proposed Directive and the competent authorities in the field of supervision of regulated entities ( credit institutions , insurance undertakings , and investment firms and perhaps also collective asset management firms ) .
The ECB suggests that the usefulness be considered of a provision foreseeing the possibility or even obligation of close cooperation between supervisors in the meaning of the proposed Directive and supervisors of regulated entities .
Both functions may benefit from cooperation and exchange of information between the respective supervisory authorities .
Regulated entities may simultaneously be involved both as Â issuer Â ( see Article 2 ( 1 )( d )) , Â person making the offer Â ( see Article 2 ( 1 )( e )) , and as Â the financial institution in charge of the public offer procedures Â ( see Article 21 ( 1 )) . Transactions in these capacities with indications hinting at misconduct may give rise to reputational risk or question the adequacy of management procedures of an institution under supervision by a competent authority .
The ECB supports the requirement that the issue prospectus shall be available in an electronic format to the general public on the websites of the competent national authorities . The information should be made available to any holder or potential holder immediately on request .
Regarding the detailed technical rules referred to in Article 12 ( 7 ) of the proposed Directive , the ECB would suggest that they be extended to the reporting of the prospectuses ( in addition to publication and availability ) . ( 1 ) OJ L 310 , 11.12.2000 , p. 1 .
The ECB notes that , while it is generally understood that at least some regulated financial entities may act as Â the financial institution in charge of the public offer procedures Â it is less clear how this wording , used in Article 21 of the proposed Directive , fits with the definitions used for this kind of service in the sectoral directives .
The ECB suggests that it be considered using harmonised definitions to the widest extent possible .
In this respect it might be clarified with regard to the proposed Directive whether Â underwriting Â is encompassed
C 344/7
While the proposed Directive includes Â placing of securities through financial intermediaries Â in the definition of such an offer , the Investment Services Directive ( 93/22 / EEC ) ( 1 ) in paragraph 4 of Section A of its Annex introduces a distinction between Â underwriting Â and Â the placing of such issues Â.
Furthermore , the codified Banking Directive ( 2000/12 / EC ) ( 2 ) refers in paragraph 8 of Annex I to Â participation in securities issues and the provision of services related to such issues Â when listing the activities that are subject to mutual recognition .
Thus , the ECB sees benefits in a clearer identification and further harmonisation of what constitutes an offer and the placing of securities in the proposed Directive , also in the light of the current review of the Investment Services Directive .

GUIDELINE OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK of 10 January 2001 adopting certain provisions on the 2002 cash changeover ( ECB / 2001/1 ) ( 2001/151 / EC ) THE GOVERNING COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK ,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community ( hereinafter referred to as the Â« Treaty ') , and in particular to Article 106 ( 1 ) thereof , and to Articles 16 and 26.4 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank ( hereinafter referred to as the Â« Statute ') , Whereas : ( 1 )
given as collateral through appropriate arrangements or cash given as collateral in the form of a deposit on a dedicated account remunerated with the same rate as applied for minimum reserves or in another form deemed appropriate by the NCBs .
According to Article 10 of Council Regulation ( EC ) No 974/98 of 3 May 1998 on the introduction of the euro ( 1 ) , as from 1 January 2002 , the ECB and the central banks of the participating Member States shall put into circulation banknotes denominated in euro .
Frontloading of euro banknotes before 1 January 2002 to certain target groups would alleviate the logistical burden related to the introduction of the euro and will contribute to reduce the costs associated with dual currency circulation after the end of the transitional period .
Frontloading of euro banknotes shall not have the effect of anticipated circulation of euro banknotes amongst the general public as the euro banknotes will not have legal tender status until 1 January 2002 .
Consequently , certain restrictions have to be observed in order to avoid putting euro banknotes into circulation before 1 January 2002 .
Frontloading of euro banknotes to credit institutions or to their appointed agents and sub-frontloading to other organisations may only be put in place if statutory or contractual arrangements are set forth between national central banks ( NCBs ) of the participating Member States and credit institutions .
Before 1 January 2002 euro banknotes shall be accounted off-balance sheet , but at their full face value , as there is legal certainty pursuant to Article 10 of Regulation ( EC ) No 974/98 that such banknotes will become legal tender from 1 January 2002 .
Frontloaded banknotes shall be debited at the dates and according to the debiting model specified in this Guideline .
The debiting model takes into account the additional cash holdings caused by the 2002 cash changeover .
Appropriate means to cover credit risks associated with frontloading must be taken into account .
Such means may involve the use of retention of ownership , assets
For as long as frontloaded banknotes and coins remain the property of NCBs , insurance policies or other appropriate means shall be used to cover at least the risks of damage , theft or robbery .
Penalty clauses , inspections and auditing may be used in order to cover the risk of anticipated public use of the frontloaded euro banknotes and with the sole purpose of verifying the presence of the frontloaded banknotes .
Frontloading of euro banknotes is a logistical operation aimed at facilitating the implementation of the national cash changeover scenarios for which NCBs are primarily responsible .
When implementing this Guideline , NCBs shall endeavour to follow an unbureaucratic and flexible approach , shall take into account national peculiarities and shall attempt to minimise the burden on the credit sector in order to ensure a smooth cash changeover .
It is acknowledged that while the primary competence for establishing the regime for the issuance of euro coins lies with the participating Member States , the NCBs play an essential role in the distribution of the euro coins .
Therefore those provisions of this Guideline which relate to euro coins are of a supplementary nature and are only to be applied by NCBs within the framework set up by the competent national authorities .
In accordance with Articles 12.1 and 14.3 of the Statute , ECB Guidelines form an integral part of Community law ,

C 324/11
EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK OPINION OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK of 24 August 1999 at the request of the Council of the European Union on a proposal for a Council Regulation ( EC ) laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Council Regulation ( EC ) No 2494/95 as regards minimum standards for the treatment of products in the health , education and social protection sectors in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices ( CON / 99/11 )
( 1999 / C 324/07 ) 1 .
On 13 August 1999 the European Central Bank ( ECB ) received a request from the Council of the European Union for an ECB opinion on a proposal for a Council Regulation ( EC ) on the abovementioned topic ( hereinafter referred to as the Â draft Regulation Â) . 5 .
The ECB 's competence to deliver an opinion is based on Article 105 ( 4 ) of the Treaty establishing the European Community and Article 5 ( 3 ) of Council Regulation ( EC ) No 2494/95 of 23 October 1995 concerning harmonised indices of consumer prices . In accordance with Article 17.5 , first sentence of the Rules of Procedure of the European Central Bank , this ECB opinion has been adopted by the Governing Council of the ECB .
Article 4 contains the essential conceptual definition of price measurement of goods and services in the health , education and social protection sectors . The two main pillars are the implementation of the Laspeyres principle and the measurement of prices net of reimbursement .
The objective of the draft Regulation is to define the methodological details for the inclusion of products in the health , education and social protection sectors and the timetable for the inclusion of certain items ( in particular hospital services , social protection services and retirement homes ) . 7 .
The reason for proposing the adoption of the draft Regulation lies in Commission Regulation ( EC ) No 1749/96 as amended by Council Regulation ( EC ) No 1687/98 .
According to this latter Regulation , coverage of the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices ( HICP ) is to be extended in the health , education and social protection sectors and the major part of the extension is to be implemeted in December 1999 .
The Regulation also states that the methodological details of inclusion should be specified in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 14 of the framework Regulation ( EC ) No 2494/95 .
In its opinion of 14 July 1998 on the aforementioned Regulation ( EC ) No 1687/98 , the ECB fully supported the extension of coverage . It supported the general concept of what should be covered by the HICP (Â household final monetary consumption expenditure Â) and explained the reasons for this view .
The ECB strongly supports the proposed date for implementation , i.e. December 1999 ( Article 9 ) .
This is essential for ensuring that the extension of coverage of the HICP which is scheduled for December 1999 according to Regulation ( EC ) No 1687/98 is implemented in a comparable manner .
The comparability of the HICP is decisive for its credibility and for the use of the HICP by the ECB .
The ECB therefore also proposes that the provision of Article 8 ( 1 ) of the draft Regulation , which enables Member States to deviate from the rules of the Regulation under certain conditions , in connection with the provision of Article 7 , which defines the comparability threshold , be clarified .
Any departure from the Regulation affecting the HICP systematically by more than one-tenth of one percentage point ( compared with the strict application of Articles 4 and 5 of the Regulation ) should be ruled out by the Regulation .
C 324/12
As already stated in its opinion of 14 July 1998 on Regulation ( EC ) No 1687/98 , the ECB would stress that the provision of sufficiently comparable back-data covering at least the year 1999 ( and , in respect of the items listed in Article 9 which are to be implemented in December 2000 , at least the year 2000 ) is highly desirable as supplementary information .
This ECB opinion will be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities .

The euro as a new world currency
Eugenio Domingo Solans , Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank Delivered in the forum on the euro , at the Bankers Club , Mexico , 10 March 1999 .
Factors determining the importance of the euro in the world economy
Whether the euro will become a new world currency - as expressed in the title given to my speech - depends on three major groups of factors .
First , it depends on what we might call the Â« habitat Â» of the euro , that is to say the relative demographic and economic importance of the euro area , which forms the base on which the currency is supported .
In this respect , not only is its present importance of relevance , but also its foreseeable future trend .
Moreover , linked to the monetary habitat , the degree of openness of the economy may also be considered in that this provides us with an idea of its capacity in relation to the rest of the world economy .
In the second place , the financial dimension is of fundamental importance in order to evaluate the world impact of the euro , this being understood as the rate of development and the level of activity of the European financial markets and institutions , both in terms of volume and the diversity of business , in addition to their degree of integration .
As with the volume and diversity of business , the degree of integration of the financial markets constitutes a factor that magnifies the external impact , and , therefore , it is a fundamental element in reinforcing the role of the euro as an international currency .
Finally , the global importance of the new European currency is also linked to the confidence inspired by the euro and the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which , in turn , depends on the stability of the currency as well as on the transparency and degree of accountability of the institution determining monetary policy .
It can already be said that a consideration of these factors gives rise to the conclusion that the euro area has , from the outset , played a decisive role in the world economy , comparable in certain respects with that of the United States , naturally being capable of significantly affecting international economic relations and - more importantly - having great potential for future development .
The Â« habitat Â» of the euro
The first factor , which we have called the habitat of the euro , is important because without a base providing sufficient critical mass , it is not possible to expect a currency to have international relevance , however high its degree of stability .
In addition to quality , quantity is required , as is suggested by the example of the reduced degree of international use of the Swiss franc in relation to other stable currencies such as the US dollar or the Deutsche Mark until 1998 .
The figures relating to the population and the GDP of the euro area illustrate this .
With 292 million inhabitants , it exceeds the population of the United States ( 270 million ) and Japan ( 127 million ) .
The GDP of the euro area is , on the other hand , equal to 76 % of the GDP of the United States ( EUR 5,774 billion as against EUR 7,592 billion ) , though it is higher than that of Japan ( EUR 3,327 billion ) .
The source of this information , which refers to 1998 , is Eurostat .
But even more important than the current figures is the potential for the future development of the euro area , in terms of population and GDP , as the so-called Â« pre-ins Â» ( Denmark , Greece , the United Kingdom and Sweden ) join the Eurosystem .
The entry of these countries will result in a monetary area of 376 million inhabitants , 39 % larger than the United States and almost triple the size of Japan , with a GDP of EUR 7,495 billion , only slightly less than that of the United States and 125 % higher than that of Japan .
Naturally , the entry of Britain into the Eurosystem - which for me , personally , would be most desirable , although I must , of course , respect the decision of the British citizens - would make the main difference between the international present and future weight of the euro , as the pound sterling is currently the fourth world currency after the dollar , the euro and the yen .
All these facts which demonstrate the demographic and economic importance of the European Union would be further strengthened by expansion into Eastern Europe .
Our continent has a historical , cultural and geographical identity - from the Iberian Peninsula to the Urals , with certain additional external territories - which , in the future , may also come to form an economic unit .
But that is , for the moment , a distant prospect .
The degree of openness of an economic area is also a relevant factor as regards the international impact of its currency .
In this respect the euro area is more open than the United States or Japan , with a percentage of external trade of around 25.8% of GDP , as compared with 19.6% for the United States and 17.9% in the case of Japan ( data from Eurostat for 1997 ) .
However , a euro area consisting of the 15 countries of the European Union and , therefore , more closed by the mere arithmetic fact that the transactions with the present Â« pre-ins Â» would become domestic transactions , would result in a coefficient of openness of 19.4% , similar to that of the United States .
Clearly , the size and the degree of openness are parameters that move in opposite directions , so that the larger the euro area , the smaller its degree of openness to other countries .
The financial dimension of the euro
In considering the financial dimension of the euro area , the first relevant feature to observe is the low level of capitalisation of the stock markets in comparison with the United States and Japan .
Compared with a stock-market capitalisation of EUR 3190.9 billion in our markets , that in the United States presents a figure triple this amount ( EUR 9679.7 billion ) and even Japan exceeded the euro area ( EUR 3300.9 billion ) ( statistics from Eurostat , October 1998 ) .
There would be a marked difference if one were to take all 15 countries of the European Union ( a stock-exchange capitalisation of EUR 6055.4 billion ) due to the importance of the London stock exchange .
There is no doubt that , from the financial standpoint , the entry of the United Kingdom into the euro area would be a considerable boost and that - without questioning the financial importance of markets such as Frankfurt , Paris , Madrid or Milan - London , as a financial centre , would make the difference , not only quantitatively but also qualitatively from the point of view of globalisation , as it forms the bridge between Europe and the United States .
Significant and prolonged maladjustments between the economic and financial spheres are such exceptional situations that they require an explanation .
In the case of Europe the said exception does not in fact arise , as the lower degree of development of the capital markets is offset by a higher degree of banking , which , in short , signifies that the financial base of real economic activity is sustained in Europe by bank intermediation , which is also a feature of the Japanese economy .
Thus , for example , while private domestic credit in the euro area amounts to 92.4% of GDP , in the United States it is only 68.9% .
Conversely , fixed domestic income represents 34.2% of GDP in the euro area as compared with 66.1% of GDP in the United States ( statistics from the International Monetary Fund and the Bank for International Settlements as at the end of 1997 taken from the Monthly Bulletin of the European Central Bank 1999 ) .
We therefore have two distinct models of private financing which cannot be separated from the different degree of integration of the American and European capital markets , a matter to which we shall return later .
The stability of the currency and the credibility of the ECB
The basic attribute of the euro is stability .
At the ECB the stability of the currency which it is responsible for regulating is considered a priority .
Compared with the idea of its stability , the strength of the euro is of lesser importance , which does not mean that the exchange rate of the euro does not constitute an element to be considered in the monetary policy strategy of the ECB .
However , the basic factor that will determine the importance of the euro as a widely used currency in the world economy , in addition to its habitat and the financial dimension of the euro area , is , without a doubt , the stability of the new currency , by means of which a guarantee of maintenance of the purchasing power of savings can always be provided .
In the global economy frequent mention is made of the international spillovers of financial crises by means of different mechanisms ( devaluations of weak currencies , subsequent increases in interest rates , etc ) .
Less is said about the spillover or transmission of positive economic circumstances , such as stability .
The Eurosystem will Â« export Â» stability to the rest of the world economy , and not only in the case of those countries which decide to tie their currencies , formally or otherwise , to the euro ( ERM II , economies of the area of influence of the euro ) .
In the global economy the euro area will not be an island of stability , but there will be a tendency for stability to be transmitted to the rest of the economic world as the volume of transactions increases .
Stability is the basic requirement of a good currency .
It is what we at the ECB want for the euro .
We want a stable euro , not necessarily a strong euro .
In the long term the euro will derive strength from its stability .
The stability of the euro is the basis or foundation of the confidence in and credibility of the ECB , without which a euro with a high international profile is unthinkable .
Stability is the proof of the efficacy of the institution .
Yet in order to be credible it is not sufficient for the ECB to be efficient .
Other parameters of its action must be considered : accountability , transparency and communication , a European-wide perspective .
The conditions for the success of the euro as a new world currency are certainly demanding .
And the achievement of these conditions is the aim of those of us who have responsibilities in the operation of the ECB .
It is said that , of the 82 million Germans , not all of them believe in God , but they all believe in the Bundesbank .
How many of the 292 million inhabitants of the euro area believe in the ECB ?
That is the question .
Future trends
The initial situation of the euro as an international currency is , having regard to the factors considered , solid .
Apart from this encouraging , albeit incipient , base , how will the euro perform as an international reserve currency ?
Ignoring the advice of Mark Twain to avoid making predictions , above all if they relate to the future , it can be ventured that , in an initial phase , the international role of the euro will be greater as a currency for financial investment by market participants and as a reserve currency by the central banks than as a vehicle for the exchange of goods and services in the world economy .
That is to say , the euro will be used internationally more as a store of value than as a medium of exchange .
There is reason to believe that private investors will have a tendency to increase the proportion of their portfolios denominated in euro in comparison with their holdings in the 10 currencies which became a single currency .
The solid economic base supporting the euro , the confidence in its stability and in the monetary policy of the ECB as well as the increasing development and integration of the hitherto fragmented European monetary and financial market - which , in turn , will increase its liquidity - are the principal factors confirming such a belief .
The integration of the European monetary markets relies , of course , on the existence of a single system of refinancing the banks in the euro area , that is to say on the common monetary policy .
But it also relies technically on a system of instantaneous data transfer and on the new common payments system , TARGET , enabling real-time gross settlement .
Thanks to the smooth operation of the systems of information , communication and payments , a common monetary policy is realistic and the integration of the markets can take place .
Such integration will , in turn , involve greater liquidity and further development of the financial markets .
A specific channel through which the monetary policy of the ECB and the TARGET system can have a direct impact on the development of the financial markets of the euro area is via the requirement to have guarantees or collateral for operations with the ECB .
This requirement of adequate collateral , especially in the case of the banking institutions of certain financial systems , can stimulate the process of loans securitisation .
The underlying assets can be used across borders , which means that a banking institution in a country belonging to the European System of Central Banks ( ESCB ) can receive funds from its national central bank making use of assets located in other countries , which is also relevant from the perspective of integration of the financial markets of the area .
The trend towards further integration of the European financial markets , accompanied by increased use of the euro as a vehicle for international investment , should logically follow a process which would start in the short-term money market , subsequently be expanded to the longer-term money market and finally extend to the public and private bond and equity markets .
In the short term there must be a tendency for the differentials in money-market interest rates to be eliminated , as the market improves , while in the long-term securities markets - naturally , both public and private - interest rates will always include a risk premium , linked to the degree of solvency of the country ( deficit and public debt , commitments on pensions ) or to the credit risk of the private company issuing the loan , as well as the liquidity of the securities .
As a medium of exchange in the trade of goods and services , the euro will possibly develop more slowly and will need time to achieve a situation comparable with that of the dollar .
The American currency has a dominant position in this respect and , as economies of scale exist in this connection , there is a tendency for its use to be reinforced .
Just as it took decades for the dollar to substitute the pound sterling as a vehicle for international trade , so it will take time for the euro to reach a position where it is playing a role comparable with that of the dollar .
This will depend , in any case , on the different markets ( the dollar is proportionately more rooted in the derivatives exchanges ) and the different geographical areas ( Eastern Europe and North Africa will be more Â« euroised Â» regions and Latin America more Â« dollarised ') .
In any event , it is important to emphasise that the ECB will not adopt a belligerent stance to force the use of the euro in the world economy .
This will take place spontaneously , slowly yet inexorably , without any impulses other than those based on desire and the free decision of the market participants , with no logic other than that of the market .
It is certainly the case that advantages are gained from the international use of a currency , such as income from seignorage , but there are also disadvantages , such as the complication of the formulation or implementation of monetary policy .
Neither does the ECB have the intention to co-ordinate the movement of its interest rates with other central banks , such as the US Federal Reserve , or to peg or limit the fluctuations in the euro exchange rate with other currencies outside the ESCB , in particular the US dollar .
Having regard to the desirability of reducing , as far as possible , the relative volatility of the dollar and the euro , it should nevertheless be affirmed that the establishment , officially or unofficially , implicitly or explicitly , of certain fluctuation bands between the exchange rates of the dollar and of the euro would represent an error of economic policy and this idea is therefore dismissed by the ECB .
It is important to emphasise in this connection the impossibility of simultaneously achieving two independent objectives - price stability and exchange rate stability - with a single instrument of monetary policy .
If there were a set fluctuation band for the euro exchange rate , the said exchange rate objective could come into conflict with price stability and the ECB would not be fulfilling its primary objective .
To have simultaneously pegged exchange rates , free movement of capital and monetary autonomy is simply impossible .
This is precisely the reason why the countries of the Eurosystem have transferred their monetary autonomy to the ECB , which acts as a single monetary authority within an economic area whose exchange rates are completely fixed ( single currency ) and with free movement of capital ( single market ) .
And exactly the same argument explains that two different monetary authorities , each with its own decision-making autonomy ( the US Federal Reserve and the ECB ) in an environment of free movement of capital , cannot hope successfully to peg the exchange rates of their respective currencies in the face of deep-rooted trends in the markets in divergent directions .
Instead of establishing set exchange rate fluctuation bands , European experience has shown that certain good common macroeconomic fundamentals represent the best strategy for achieving a better co-ordination of exchange rates .
The political factor
Monetary Union is always a political operation , irrespective of its technical and economic implications .
Currency is one of the most genuine expressions of sovereignty because the power to issue money is one of the greatest powers in existence .
The strength it affords was perceived by rulers who did not hesitate to monopolise it and take advantage of it , not always to the benefit of the people .
The Treaty on European Union led , first , to the depoliticisation of monetary power in Europe , by means of granting independence to the central banks and prohibiting the monetising of public deficits , and then to denationalisation or supranationalisation ( via the ESCB ) , not only for the purpose of improving the operation of the single market , but also to make progress in the building of the European political structure .
One of the greatest differences between the euro and the other world currencies is that the European currency is denationalised and supranationalised .
The euro does not have behind it a political power as strong and as cohesive as that of the dollar .
This has consequences of a technical nature which the ECB , as the body responsible for issuing euro , takes into account , for example , in the fight against money counterfeiting .
But it may also have other consequences relating to its use as an international reserve currency , to the extent that the public may have more confidence in a currency which , in addition to the guarantee of an independent central bank , has the support of a strong political power .
If this were the case , it would represent an assertion in favour of continuing with the decision to build the European political structure , one of whose supports is the euro .
The relationship between political power and monetary power is an interesting subject open to investigation and discussion , which certainly goes beyond the scope of this speech .
I merely wish to point out that , in the case of Europe , it is clearly apparent that following the achievement of a single currency , the door remains open to political union , which would represent a crucial step in the process of integration .
In conclusion , it would seem clear that the implications of a world currency such as the euro go Â« beyond supply and demand Â» ( to use the title of the work of Wilhelm RÃ¶pke ) .
We are fully immersed in the Â« meta-economy Â» , which means it is time to end my speech .

2 January 2007 - Slovenia joins the euro area
Yesterday , on 1 January 2007 , the euro was introduced in Slovenia .
Slovenia has thus become the 13th EU Member State to adopt the single currency and is the first of the new Member States to join Economic and Monetary Union in Europe .
As a result of the adoption of the euro by Slovenia , Banka Slovenije is now a full member of the Eurosystem , with the same rights and obligations as the 12 national central banks of the other EU Member States that have adopted the euro .
In accordance with Article 49 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank , Banka Slovenije has paid up the remainder of its contribution to the capital of the ECB .
Banka Slovenije has also transferred to the ECB its contribution to the foreign reserve assets of the ECB .
The integration of the Slovenian monetary financial institutions into the euro area banking system on 1 January 2007 was already taken into account in the publication of the euro area liquidity needs and in the benchmark allotment on 27 and 28 December 2006 .
The Slovenian counterparties of the Eurosystem will be able to participate in the Eurosystem 's main refinancing operations for the first time on 3 January 2007 .
The list of monetary financial institutions located in Slovenia and subject to reserve requirements is published on the ECB 's website , as are the lists of the other EU Member States that have adopted the euro .
The list of assets located in Slovenia and eligible as collateral for the credit operations of the Eurosystem is also available on the ECB 's website .

Monetary analysis
Within the set of selected key indicators that it monitors and studies on a regular basis , the ECB assigns a high importance to monetary aggregates .
Its monetary analysis relies on the fact that monetary growth and inflation are closely related in the medium to long run , thus underpinning the medium-term orientation of the ECB 's monetary policy strategy .
The analysis of credit and liquidity conditions enables the ECB to see beyond the transient impact of the various shocks .
In order to signal its commitment to monetary analysis and to provide a benchmark for the assessment of monetary developments , the ECB has announced a reference value for the broad monetary aggregate M3 . This reference value refers to the rate of M3 growth that is deemed to be compatible with price stability over the medium term .
The reference value therefore represents a Â« natural Â» benchmark for analysing the information content of monetary developments in the euro area .
The ECB 's monetary analysis assesses on a regular basis the growth of the broad monetary aggregate M3 , but also many other monetary and financial variables .
For example , developments in the components of M3 ( e.g. cash in circulation , time deposits ) are studied because they can offer an insight into the overall changes in M3 .
In this respect , narrower aggregates such as M1 may contain some information about real activity .
Similarly , changes in credit extended to the private sector can be informative about financial conditions and , through the monetary financial institutions ( MFI ) balance sheet , can provide additional information about money .
Such analysis helps to provide both a better insight into the behaviour of M3 in relation to the reference value and a broad picture of the liquidity conditions in the economy and their consequences in terms of risks to price stability .
Finally , the analysis of money and credit may , under certain circumstances , provide early information on developing financial instability .
Such information is of relevance for monetary policy because the emergence of financial imbalances or asset price bubbles could have a destabilising effect on activity and , ultimately , prices in the medium term .
Monetary aggregates
M1 has been defined as currency in circulation plus overnight deposits .
M2 comprises M1 plus deposits with an agreed maturity of up to and including two years and deposits redeemable at notice of up to and including three months .
M3 comprises M2 plus repurchase agreements , money market fund shares and units as well as debt securities with a maturity of up to and including two years .

The national central banks as integral part of the Eurosystem
Each national central bank ( NCB ) has legal personality according to the national law of its respective country .
The euro area NCBs , which form an integral part of the Eurosystem , carry out the tasks conferred upon the Eurosystem in accordance with the rules established by the ECB 's decision-making bodies .
The NCBs also contribute to the work of the Eurosystem and the European System of Central Banks ( ESCB ) through their participation in the various Eurosystem / ESCB Committees ( see also separate slide Â« Eurosystem / ESCB Committees ") .
They may perform non-Eurosystem functions on their own responsibility , unless the Governing Council finds that such functions interfere with the objectives and tasks of the Eurosystem .
Such non-Eurosystem functions vary according to countries and mainly consist of various types of financial and administrative services to the governments of the respective countries .
Most NCBs for example are involved in the supervision of financial institutions in their respective countries and some NCBs run their own printing works for the production of banknotes .

For the Governing Council of the ECB The President Willem F. DUISENBERG
The introduction of the euro in Greece as of 1 January 2001 entails the submission of credit institutions located in Greece and branches in Greece of credit institutions to the ESCB 's minimum reserves system as of the same date .
The integration of these entities into the ESCB 's minimum reserves system requires the adoption of transitional provisions in order to ensure smooth integration without creating a disproportionate burden for credit institutions in participating Member States , including Greece .

The audit subject selected for the 2004 financial year was the efficiency of human resources policy at the ECB .
The Court also did a follow-up audit on the monitoring of projects and on the procurement and management of external services .
HUMAN RESOURCES POLICY 2 .
The ECB 's 2004 budget amounted to 376,4 million euro , of which staff
costs were 145,9 million euro ( 39 %) 2 .
Since its inception in 1999 the ECB has experienced a period of rapid
growth , from 518 staff members in 1999 to 1 309 staff members at the end of 2004 .
In its start-up phase , the Directorate Human Resources ( D-HR ) was mainly occupied with recruitment , day-to-day administrative tasks and coping with short-term constraints regarding human resources policy .
In the current consolidation phase , the ECB has identified3 several areas for improvement and fields for action in the HR ( Human Resources ) area .
Article 27 ( 2 ) stipulates Â« The provisions of Article 248 of the Treaty shall only apply to an examination of the operational efficiency of the management of the ECB Â» .
The institutional provisions relating to the European Central Bank are included in Article 110 of the EC Treaty .
Comprising 133,2 million euro of direct salary costs and 12,7 million euro of indirect human resources costs , such as recruitment and removal allowances .
Within the context of an organisational change programme called Â« ECB in Motion Â» , the Executive Board launched a number of surveys conducted among staff in order to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the ECB .

compensation , and absence management .
The Court assessed whether the ECB had : developed a comprehensive and coherent HR policy addressing its organisational needs ;
established adequate mechanisms at the central level for monitoring the implementation of its HR policy ;
5 . properly implemented its HR policy at all levels .
The completeness of the ECB 's human resources policy in the selected
areas was compared with other international organisations , these being the European Investment Bank ( EIB ) , the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development ( EBRD ) and the EU institutions .
In addition , the Court examined the management information available to the central services of the ECB to monitor the implementation of HR policy .
In a sample of Business Areas4 the Court then reviewed how the HR policy in the selected areas was being implemented .
Over the years , the ECB has developed a coherent HR policy addressing its main organisational needs .
However , there is still room for improvement in the areas of recruitment , grading , disciplinary action and the prevention of bullying and harassment . For some of these areas , full compliance with Council Directives has not yet been achieved .
While mechanisms have been established at the central level for monitoring the implementation of HR policy , the monitoring role of D-HR still shows weaknesses , particularly in the areas of recruitment , training organised by Business Areas and leave and absence management .
The term Â« Business Areas Â» is used in the text for Â« Directorates General Â» and Â« Directorates Â» of the ECB .
Overall , the ECB has implemented most of its HR policy at all levels
according to the policy it had established , although weaknesses relating to consistency and uniformity were found in the areas of salary setting , bonus distribution , recruitment and training .
However , the most significant weakness concerned the low level of compliance with the leave and absence rules .
The Court recommends that the ECB should : make its HR policy more comprehensive and review it more regularly to keep it updated , having regard to developments in comparable international organisations ;
strengthen the central monitoring function in the HR area in order to ensure that HR policy is equally implemented throughout the ECB and introduce performance measurement in the HR area by using key performance indicators and critical success factors ;
address the problems found in the leave and absence area by improved monitoring , clearer communication and a better definition of responsibilities .
FOLLOW-UP OF PREVIOUS OBSERVATIONS 10 .
The Court carried out a follow-up audit on the monitoring of projects5 and on the procurement and management of external services6 .
Central monitoring is only performed for projects with IT involvement and only encompasses IT resources .
Other projects are still only monitored locally by the Business Areas concerned without an independent second level of control for these activities at prioritisation , approving and monitoring level .
5 Furthermore , nearly half of the projects monitored at the central level in 2004 were subject to delays of more than 20 % compared to the initial planning .
A new Administrative Circular on the ECB 's Procurement Rules was issued in September 2003 and a prototype database has been developed to record all exemptions to the Procurement Rules with an amount above 10 000 euro and all large purchases ( amount above 250 000 euro ) .
However , the ECB has still not implemented quality control of work performed by consultants and suppliers , neither at central monitoring level nor at the decentralised level .
This report was adopted by the Court of Auditors in Luxembourg at its meeting of 5 April 2006 . For the Court of Auditors
Hubert Weber President
REPLY OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK TO THE REPORT BY THE COURT OF AUDITORS ON THE AUDIT OF THE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY OF THE MANAGEMENT OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK FOR THE 2004 FINANCIAL YEAR
The European Central Bank ( ECB ) welcomes the report of the European Court of Auditors for the financial year 2004 and expresses its appreciation of the Court 's acknowledgment that the ECB has developed a coherent HR policy addressing its main organisational needs .
The ECB takes note of the findings and recommendations for improvement made by the Court .
In this respect , the ECB has prioritised the development of a diversity policy and a framework for preventing bullying and harassment .
Work on these issues is now in its final stage .
Although the ECB 's practice complies with the substance of the European Union Directives , the ECB will address further improvements to ensure that its rules and regulations fully reflect the Directives .
In all policy development projects , the ECB takes account of developments not only in comparable international organisations , but also in the other national central banks of the European System of Central Banks .
Furthermore , as regards compliance with leave and absence rules , particular attention will be given to improving the monitoring of absence management in the near future .
With regard to performance measurement in the HR area , the ECB has decided on a process to gradually introduce key performance indicators .
Major IT - and non-IT-related projects have always been centrally monitored by the ECB 's Project Steering Committee .
Since the third quarter of 2005 , the Project Steering Committee 's central monitoring has been extended to cover all IT related projects thereby covering the vast majority of the ECB 's project undertaking .
The quality control of work performed by consultants and suppliers is carried out as an integrated part of line management responsibility .

Division of labour in the Eurosystem
The Eurosystem consists of the ECB and the national central banks ( NCBs ) of those EU countries that have adopted the euro .
Under Article 8 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks ( ESCB Statute ) , it is the ECB 's decision-making bodies that govern the Eurosystem . Within their respective responsibilities , these bodies take all the decisions that are necessary to enable the Eurosystem to carry out its tasks .
Except for the statutory tasks that have been exclusively assigned to the ECB , the ESCB Statute does not indicate to what extent ECB policies are to be implemented through activities of the ECB or the NCBs .
For the bulk of the Eurosystem 's activities , the actual intra-System division of labour has been guided by the principle of decentralisation , with the ECB having recourse to the NCBs , to the extent deemed possible and appropriate , to carry out operations which form part of the tasks of the Eurosystem ( cf. Article 12.1 of the ESCB Statute ) .
Thus , the ECB and the NCBs jointly contribute to attaining the Eurosystem 's common goals .
However , according to Article 9.2 of the Statute , the ECB has to ensure that all tasks are carried out properly and consistently . To ensure this across the euro area , the ECB has the power to issue guidelines and instructions to the NCBs .

26 June 2003 - Oversight standards for euro retail payment systems
In carrying out its statutory task of promoting the smooth operation of payment systems , the Eurosystem has been refining its policy stance on retail payment systems .
The Â« Oversight standards for euro retail payment systems Â» (' Retail Standards ') adopted today by the Governing Council of the European Central Bank will ensure a harmonised and systematic oversight of retail payment systems in the euro area .
These standards draw on the Core Principles for Systemically Important Payment Systems [ Bank for International Settlements , January 2001 ] (' Core Principles ') which apply to large-value payment systems .
The standards adopted today contain indicators for categorising retail payment systems into systemically important retail payment systems , retail systems of prominent importance and other retail payment systems .
All Core Principles will be applied to systemically important retail payment systems , whereas only a selection of six Core Principles will be applied to systems of prominent importance .
Other retail payment systems will have to comply with any other applicable standards ( e.g. Eurosystem standards for e-money schemes or nationally adopted standards ) .
The Eurosystem will now categorise retail payment systems in the euro area and assess all systems against the relevant standards .
This categorisation and assessment will enhance the stability and soundness of retail payment systems .
The standards address legal safety , financial risk management , security and operational reliability , efficiency , access criteria and system governance .
The adoption of the Retail Standards follows a process of public consultation which was launched on 8 July 2002 with the publication of the draft Â« Oversight standards for euro retail payment systems Â» .
Comments were supportive and welcomed the transparency shown by the Eurosystem in further developing its retail payment systems policy .
Above all , commentators sought a level playing-field .
Market participants requested publication of a transparent methodology which would allow a transparent categorisation of retail payment systems in the euro area .
They requested that the Eurosystem provide clarification with regard to the classification of euro retail payment systems and the oversight standards that will apply to them .
Furthermore , comments were received on the scope of the Retail Standards and the time-frame for their implementation .
The Eurosystem appreciates the comments received . They will all be made available in English on the ECB 's website .
The Eurosystem has taken account of these comments . The comments did not lead to a change in the substance of the standards but to a more detailed explanation of the Eurosystem 's policy stance and an explanation of the methodology used to identify retail payment systems that are of systemic importance and retail systems that are of prominent importance .
The final English version of the Eurosystem 's Â« Oversight standards for euro retail payment systems Â» is published together with this press release .
( Hard copies can be obtained by writing to the ECB 's Press and Information Division at the address given below .
) It is also made available , together with the English version of the Eurosystem 's response to the main comments received (' Oversight standards for euro retail payment systems -- response to the comments received by public consultation ') , in the Â« Public consultations Â» section of the ECB 's website .
Both documents will be available in all official Community languages in due course .

9 September 2010 - Monthly Bulletin
Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses , the Governing Council at its meeting on 2 September 2010 viewed the current key ECB interest rates as appropriate and therefore decided to leave them unchanged .
Considering all the new information and analyses that have become available since its meeting on 5 August 2010 , the Governing Council continues to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon , benefiting from low domestic price pressures .
Recent economic data for the euro area have been stronger than expected , partly owing to temporary factors .
Looking ahead , the recovery should proceed at a moderate pace , with uncertainty still prevailing .
On 2 September 2010 the Governing Council also decided to continue to conduct its main refinancing operations ( MROs ) and its special-term refinancing operations with a maturity of one maintenance period as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment for as long as necessary , and at least until the end of this year 's twelfth maintenance period on 18 January 2011 .
The fixed rate in these special-term refinancing operations will be the same as the MRO rate prevailing at the time .
Furthermore , it decided to conduct the 3-month longer-term refinancing operations ( LTROs ) , to be carried out in October , November and December 2010 , as fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment .
The rates in these 3-month operations will be fixed at the average rate of the MROs over the life of the respective LTRO .
The Governing Council also decided to carry out three additional fine-tuning operations on 30 September , 11 November and 23 December , when 6-month and 12-month refinancing operations mature .
The Governing Council remains firmly committed to maintaining price stability over the medium to longer term . The monetary policy stance , the overall provision of liquidity and the allotment modes will be adjusted as appropriate .
Euro area real GDP grew strongly on a quarterly basis , increasing by 1.0% in the second quarter of 2010 , supported by ongoing growth at the global level , but also in part reflecting temporary domestic factors .
Recent data and survey evidence generally confirm the expectation of a moderation in the second half of this year , both at the global level and in the euro area .
Nevertheless , while uncertainty still prevails , they continue to indicate a positive underlying momentum of the recovery in the euro area .
Ongoing growth at the global level and its impact on the demand for euro area exports , together with the accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system , should continue to support the euro area economy .
However , the recovery in activity is expected to be dampened by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors and labour market prospects .
This assessment is also reflected in the September 2010 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area , according to which annual real GDP growth will range between 1.4% and 1.8% in 2010 and between 0.5% and 2.3% in 2011 .
Compared with the June 2010 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections , the range for real GDP growth this year has been revised upwards , owing to the stronger than expected rebound in economic growth in the second quarter as well as better than expected developments over the summer months .
For 2011 the range has also been revised upwards , reflecting mainly carry-over effects from the projected stronger growth towards the end of 2010 .
In the Governing Council 's assessment , the risks to this improved economic outlook are slightly tilted to the downside , with uncertainty still prevailing .
On the one hand , global trade may continue to perform more strongly than expected , thereby supporting euro area exports .
On the other hand , concerns remain relating to the emergence of renewed tensions in financial markets and to some uncertainty about growth prospects in other advanced economies and at the global level .
In addition , downside risks relate to renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices , and protectionist pressures , as well as the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances .
With regard to price developments , euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.6% in August , according to Eurostat 's flash estimate , compared with 1.7% in July .
The small decline in inflation is likely to reflect base effects in the energy component .
Later in the year annual HICP inflation rates are expected to increase slightly , while displaying some volatility .
Looking further ahead , in 2011 inflation rates should remain moderate overall , benefiting from low domestic price pressures .
This assessment is also reflected in the September 2010 ECB staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area , which foresee annual HICP inflation in a range between 1.5% and 1.7% for 2010 and between 1.2% and 2.2% for 2011 .
Compared with the Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections of June 2010 , the ranges have been revised slightly upwards , largely on account of higher commodity prices .
Risks to the outlook for price developments are slightly tilted to the upside . They relate , in particular , to the evolution of energy and non-oil commodity prices .
Turning to the monetary analysis , the annual growth rate of M3 stood at 0.2% in July 2010 , unchanged from June .
The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector , which has been gradually increasing , rose further to 0.9% , but still remains relatively weak .
The subdued developments in money and loan growth continue to support the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that inflationary pressures over the medium term are contained .
The downward impact of the steep yield curve on monetary growth , which is reflected in the allocation of funds into longer-term deposits and securities outside M3 , is gradually waning .
Moreover , the impact of the narrow spreads between different short-term interest rates on the growth of the components of M3 is continuing to diminish .
As a result , the annual growth rate of M1 has continued to moderate from high levels , and stood at 8.1% in July 2010 , while the annual growth rate of other short-term deposits has become less negative .
The still weak annual growth rate of bank loans to the non-financial private sector continues to conceal positive growth in loans to households and diminishing negative annual growth in loans to non-financial corporations .
These developments are consistent with a normal , lagged response of loan developments to economic activity over the business cycle .
Given the subdued developments in banks Â» overall balance sheets , the challenge remains for banks to expand the availability of credit to the non-financial sector when demand picks up .
Where necessary , to address this challenge , banks should retain earnings , turn to the market to strengthen further their capital bases or take full advantage of government support measures for recapitalisation .
Considering all the new information and analyses which have become available since its meeting on 5 August 2010 , the Governing Council continues to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon , benefiting from low domestic price pressures .
Turning to fiscal policies , current developments at the euro area aggregate level appear to be broadly in line with previous expectations .
At the country level , any positive fiscal developments that may emerge , reflecting factors such as a more favourable than expected macroeconomic environment , should be exploited to make faster progress with fiscal consolidation .
At the same time , in countries where there is still a need to take additional specific measures to achieve consolidation targets , such measures should be adopted swiftly to ensure that consolidation commitments are fulfilled .
This is a prerequisite for maintaining confidence in the credibility of governments Â» fiscal targets .
Positive effects on confidence can compensate for the reduction in demand stemming from fiscal consolidation , when fiscal adjustment strategies are perceived as credible , ambitious and focused on the expenditure side .
The conditions for such positive effects are particularly favourable in the current environment of macroeconomic uncertainty .
In order to support the process of fiscal consolidation , to underpin the proper functioning of the euro area and to strengthen the prospects for higher sustainable growth , the pursuit of far-reaching structural reforms is essential .
Major reforms are particularly needed in those countries that have experienced a loss of competitiveness in the past or that are suffering from high fiscal and external deficits .
Measures should ensure a wage bargaining process that allows wages to adjust flexibly and appropriately to the unemployment situation and losses in competitiveness .
Reforms to strengthen productivity growth would further support the adjustment process of these economies . back to top

At its meeting on 6 April 2006 , on the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses , the Governing Council decided to keep the key ECB interest rates unchanged , following the increase of 25 basis points on 2 March 2006 .
The information which has become available since the March decision confirms the Governing Council 's assessment that the further adjustment of the accommodative monetary policy stance in March was warranted to address upside risks to price stability .
It remains essential to ensure that medium to long-term inflation expectations in the euro area are kept solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability .
With interest rates across the whole maturity spectrum still at very low levels in both nominal and real terms , and monetary and credit growth remaining strong and liquidity ample , monetary policy remains accommodative .
The Governing Council will continue to monitor very closely all developments to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise .
Starting with the economic analysis , recent information has confirmed the Governing Council 's assessment of an improved outlook for economic growth in the euro area , following the more subdued developments in late 2005 .
On the basis of the latest data , survey releases and various indicator-based estimates , it appears that growth is strengthening and broadening in the first half of 2006 .
Indeed , the conditions remain in place for solid growth over the coming quarters .
Activity in the world economy remains strong , providing support for euro area exports .
Investment activity is expected to remain solid , benefiting from an extended period of very favourable financing conditions , balance sheet restructuring , and accumulated and ongoing gains in earnings and business efficiency .
Consumption growth should also strengthen over time , in line with developments in real disposable income , as the labour market situation continues to gradually improve .
This outlook for economic activity is also confirmed by available forecasts from international organisations and private sector institutions .
The risks to economic growth appear to be broadly balanced over the shorter term .
Further ahead , downside risks still relate to potential increases in oil prices and concerns about global imbalances .
In relation to price developments , according to Eurostat 's flash estimate , annual HICP inflation was 2.2% in March 2006 , compared with 2.3% in February and 2.4% in January .
In the short run , inflation rates are likely to remain above 2 %, with the precise levels depending largely on developments in the more volatile components of the index .
Beyond the short term , changes in administered prices and indirect taxes are expected to significantly affect inflation in 2006 and 2007 , and an upward impact may also be expected from the indirect effects of past oil price increases .
At the same time , wage dynamics in the euro area have remained moderate over recent quarters and growth in wages is expected to remain contained , partly reflecting strong global competitive pressures , particularly in the manufacturing sector .
Over the recent past , moderate wage trends have helped to dampen domestic inflationary pressures ;
looking ahead , it is crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities in this regard , also in the context of a more favourable economic environment .
Risks to the outlook for price developments remain on the upside and include further increases in oil prices , a possibly stronger pass-through of oil price rises into consumer prices than currently anticipated , additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes , and -- more fundamentally -- stronger wage and price developments than expected due to second-round effects of past oil price increases .
Turning to the monetary analysis , the latest developments confirm that the stimulative impact of the low level of interest rates remains the dominant factor behind the high trend rate of monetary expansion .
Moreover , the annual growth rate of credit to the private sector has continued to increase over recent months , with borrowing by households -- especially loans for house purchase -- and non-financial corporations rising rapidly .
Overall , strong monetary and credit growth in an environment of ample liquidity in the euro area continues to point to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term .
To sum up , annual inflation rates are projected to remain elevated in 2006 and 2007 , and the economic analysis indicates that the risks to price stability remain on the upside .
Given the strength of monetary growth and the ample liquidity situation in a context of improving economic activity , cross-checking the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability over the medium to long term prevail .
It is essential that medium-term inflation expectations remain firmly anchored at levels consistent with price stability .
Accordingly , the Governing Council will continue to monitor very closely all developments to ensure that risks to price stability do not materialise , thereby making an ongoing contribution to sustainable economic growth and job creation .
As regards fiscal policies , while the budgetary results reported for 2005 are mostly better than anticipated a few months ago , the budget balances planned for 2006 imply no significant progress in fiscal consolidation for the euro area as a whole .
Given the economic outlook , a faster pace of deficit reduction is necessary .
Delaying fiscal consolidation in times of improving economic activity implies risks for the medium term , as has been observed in the past .
Speeding up deficit reduction on the basis of credible and fully specified measures as part of a comprehensive reform programme would help to enhance confidence in the medium-term prospects of the euro area and prevent a repeat of past experiences , when complacency in good times contributed to persistent budgetary disequilibria .
With respect to structural reforms , the Governing Council welcomes the call by the European Council , which met in Brussels on 23-24 March 2006 , to maintain the momentum of the re-launched Lisbon strategy for growth and employment .
As emphasised by the European Council , the focus should now be on ensuring the effective , timely and comprehensive implementation of the measures agreed in the national reform programmes presented by Member States and , if necessary , on strengthening them .
These measures are designed to , among other things , enhance the sustainability and quality of public finances , promote flexible labour and product markets , support a favourable business environment , and ensure a fully operational EU internal market , including the markets for energy and services .
Applying comprehensive structural reforms is of particular importance for the euro area countries , in order to increase wage and price flexibility and the resilience to shocks , facilitate structural adjustment , raise potential output growth and job creation , and reduce price pressures , thereby facilitating the task of the single monetary policy .
The first article focuses on the importance of public expenditure reform for economic growth and stability in the euro area .
The second article reviews the main operational , IT and legal aspects of portfolio management at the ECB .
The third article provides an overview of the existing monetary and exchange rate arrangements of the euro area with third countries .

27 March 2009 - The expectations of the Eurosystem as regards the future of SEPA
The Eurosystem , which comprises the European Central Bank ( ECB ) and 16 national central banks of the euro area , is today publishing a set of expectations for different stakeholders regarding the future progress of the Single Euro Payments Area ( SEPA ) project .
The expectations , developed as a response to requests for guidance received throughout 2008 , provide support for banking communities and payment institutions .
They should also provide users with guidance regarding the adjustment of their payment-related activities and what they can expect from their bank or payment institution .
The Eurosystem 's expectations are not , however , intended to be formal requirements or legally binding .
Further progress of SEPA remains a top priority for the Eurosystem , even in turbulent times . Hence a Â« mini-SEPA Â» , i.e. a SEPA for cross-border payments only , is not acceptable .
The current financial turmoil is making more banks focus on their retail business again , with payment services standing at the core thereof .
A full migration to SEPA is now even more important since SEPA is the foundation for the future European retail payments business .
The Eurosystem expects SEPA providers ( banks and payment institutions ) to :
ensure their operational capability to send and receive SEPA payments .
Banks and payment institutions , which offer credit transfer and / or direct debit services in euro , should offer the respective SEPA instruments too .
All relevant bank identifier codes ( BICs ) should be listed in the directory of at least one infrastructure with SEPA-wide reach .
Business processes and software applications should be adapted to the SEPA requisites and SEPA standards should be introduced for communication with customers .
If a conversion of the new SEPA formats into legacy , or national , formats , and vice versa , is offered until a migration end-date , it has to be assured that there is no loss of data ; and
offer users SEPA instruments that correspond to instruments otherwise offered with legacy euro payment instruments for both sending and receiving domestic and cross-border payments within SEPA .
The active use of SEPA instruments by customers can be promoted by making SEPA instruments at least as attractive as current legacy instruments are , by actively informing customers about them and by observing the Eurosystem 's SEPA expectations and recommendations .
Regarding SEPA users , the Eurosystem expects :
companies and public administrations , including commercial and central banks , to include a reference to both the SEPA criteria of the European Payments Council ( EPC ) and the Eurosystem 's expectations in the context of their tender procedures , and also to use a payment service provider that observes the SEPA rules and expectations .
Companies and public administrations should support SEPA by providing customers with international bank account numbers ( IBANs ) and BICs , in a more obvious place than the legacy account identifiers , on invoices and other documents .
Commercial and central banks , as well as payment institutions , should use SEPA instruments and --- in case they do not conduct payments autonomously --- choose a payments service provider that observes the SEPA rules and expectations .
If the respective accounts are within the same institution , IBAN instead of legacy account identifiers should be used by banks to pay their suppliers and to effect salary payments ;
retailers --- when accepting card payments from their customers --- to consider whether the card schemes and acquirers with whom they are contracting follow the SEPA framework for cards and observe the Terms of Reference ( ToR ) for card schemes ( once available ) .
They should migrate towards Â« chip and PIN Â» ( EMV-certified ) terminals and systems using SEPA standards ( once available ) , and should promote the use of efficient card schemes at the points of sale .
If this is a viable commercial decision , they should consider accepting additional European card scheme ( s ) , once available ; and
customers to inform themselves about the IBANs of their accounts and the corresponding BICs of their banks .
Furthermore , it would be beneficial for the adoption of SEPA if they use BICs and IBANs for making payments ( preferably with SEPA payment instruments ) whenever they are indicated on invoices .
When considering banking services , customers should compare offers of banks from various SEPA countries .
When paying at the point of sale , card payments should be used , instead of less efficient means of payment , both for national and SEPA-wide transactions .
The English version of the Eurosystem 's SEPA expectations can be downloaded from the ECB 's website .
Other language versions will be available in due course .

8 October 2008 - Monetary policy decisions
Throughout the current financial crisis , central banks have engaged in continuous close consultation and have cooperated in unprecedented joint actions such as the provision of liquidity to reduce strains in financial markets .
Some easing of global monetary conditions is therefore warranted .
The minimum bid rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem will be reduced by 50 basis points to 3.75 %, with effect from the main refinancing operation to be settled on 15 October 2008 .
The interest rate on the marginal lending facility will be reduced by 50 basis points to 4.75 %, with immediate effect .
The interest rate on the deposit facility will be reduced by 50 basis points to 2.75 %, with immediate effect .

2005O0016 --- EN --- 01.01.2007 --- 001.001 --- 2 â¼B GUIDELINE OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK of 30 December 2005 on a Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer system ( TARGET ) ( ECB / 2005/16 ) ( 2006/21 / EC ) THE GOVERNING COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK , Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community and in particular to the first and fourth indents of Article 105 ( 2 ) thereof and to Articles 3.1 , 12.1 , 14.3 , 17 , 18 and 22 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank , Whereas : ( 1 )
The Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer system ( TARGET ) is governed by a legal framework which has applied from the starting date of the third stage of economic and monetary union .
Guideline ECB / 2001/3 of 26 April 2001 on a Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer system ( TARGET ) ( 1 ) has already been amended several times since its adoption and should be recast in the interests of clarity and transparency .
In order to reflect the latest developments in the TARGET legal framework , this Guideline also incorporates a number of necessary amendments concerning the removal of participants from real-time gross settlement ( RTGS ) systems , access to TARGET by entities established in third countries , TARGET operating days , the definition of close links , the suspension of access to intraday credit and the dispute resolution procedure .
Implementation and verification of this Guideline should be limited to the abovementioned amendments .
The first indent of Article 105 ( 2 ) of the Treaty and the first indent of Article 3.1 of the Statute state that one of the basic tasks to be carried out through the European System of Central Banks ( ESCB ) is to define and implement the monetary policy of the Community .
The fourth indent of Article 105 ( 2 ) of the Treaty and the fourth indent of Article 3.1 of the Statute state that another of the basic tasks to be carried out through the ESCB is to promote the smooth operation of payment systems .
Article 22 of the Statute states that the European Central Bank ( ECB ) and national central banks may provide facilities to ensure efficient and sound clearing and payment systems within the Community and with other countries .
The achievement of a single monetary policy entails the need for payment arrangements through which the monetary policy operations between national central banks and credit institutions can be effected in a timely and secure manner , and which will foster the singleness of the money market within the euro area .
Such objectives warrant a payment arrangement that operates with a high level of security , within very short processing times and at low cost . In accordance with Articles 12.1 and 14.3 of the Statute , ECB guidelines form an integral part of Community law ,

2005O0016 --- EN --- 01.01.2007 --- 001.001 --- 6 â¼B Article 2 Description of TARGET 1 .
The Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer system is a real-time gross settlement system for the euro .
TARGET is composed of the national RTGS systems , the ECB payment mechanism and interlinking .
RTGS systems may connect to TARGET via interlinking or through a bilateral link .
The RTGS systems of non-participating Member States may connect to TARGET in so far as such RTGS systems comply with the minimum common features set out in Article 3 and are able to process the euro alongside their respective national currency .
Any connection to TARGET of an RTGS system of a non-participating Member State is subject to an agreement whereby the national central banks concerned agree to adhere to the rules and procedures for TARGET referred to in this Guideline ( with specifications and modifications , where appropriate , as referred to in such an agreement ) .
When a remote NCB and credit institutions and other entities in its Member State remotely participate in a host NCB 's RTGS system in accordance with that RTGS system 's RTGS rules , the following specific additional provisions shall apply : --- the host NCB shall grant the remote NCB unlimited and uncollateralised credit , --- the host NCB and the remote NCB may agree on terms and conditions that complement the RTGS rules of the host NCB 's RTGS system , --- the remote NCB shall grant intraday credit to entities in its Member State participating in the host NCB 's RTGS system in accordance with the requirements of Article 3 ( f ) , --- payments between entities in the remote NCB 's Member State and between such entities and other participants in the host NCB 's RTGS system shall be considered as domestic payments for the purposes of pricing and other relevant matters , while payments between entities in the remote NCB 's Member State and participants in an RTGS system other than the host NCB 's RTGS system shall be considered as cross-border payments for such purposes , --- the remote NCB may appoint its representatives to the bodies referred to in Article 7 ( 2 ) and may nominate a person or persons to undertake the functions specified in Article 7 ( 3 ) .
â¼B Article 3 Minimum common features of national RTGS systems Each NCB shall ensure that its respective national RTGS system complies with the features set out below .
( a ) A c c e s s c r i t e r i a 1 . Only supervised credit institutions , as defined in Article 1 ( 1 ) of Directive 2000/12 / EC , which are established in the EEA , shall be admitted as participants in a national RTGS system .
As an exception , and without prejudice to Article 7 ( 1 ) of this Guideline , the following entities may also be admitted as participants in a national RTGS system upon approval by the relevant NCB : ( i ) treasury departments of central or regional governments of Member States active in the money markets ; 2005O0016 --- EN --- 01.01.2007 --- 001.001 --- 7 â¼B ( ii ) public sector bodies of Member States authorised to hold accounts for customers ;
( iv ) organisations providing clearing or settlement services subject to oversight by a competent authority ; ( v ) central banks established in the EU , the RTGS systems of which are not connected to TARGET .
2 . The criteria for access to a national RTGS system and the procedure for the assessment thereof shall be set out in the RTGS rules concerned and be made available to interested parties .
In addition to the criteria mentioned in Article 3 ( a )( 1 ) , these national criteria may include , inter alia : --- adequate financial strength , --- expected minimum number of transactions , --- the payment of an entry fee , --- legal , technical and operational aspects .
3 . A participant in a national RTGS system pursuant to this Article 3 ( a )( 1 ) and ( 2 ) shall have access to the cross-border payment facilities of TARGET .
4 . RTGS rules shall contain the grounds and procedures for removing a participant from the national RTGS system concerned .
The grounds for removing a participant from a national RTGS system ( by way of suspension or expulsion ) shall cover any event which entails systemic risk or could otherwise cause serious operational problems , including : ( i ) where a participant enters into insolvency proceedings , or where such proceedings are impending ;
( ii ) where a participant is in breach of the RTGS rules in question ; or ( iii ) where one or more access criteria for participation in the relevant national RTGS system are no longer fulfilled .
In addition to the above , entities of the types listed in Article 3 ( a ) ( 1 ) which are established in a country with which the Community has entered into a monetary agreement may also be admitted as participants in a national RTGS system .
Such access shall only be given where it is provided for in the relevant monetary agreement and shall be subject to the conditions set out therein .
Where relevant , and subject to the individual monetary agreements , the ECB may also at its discretion determine , on a case-by-case basis , appropriate conditions as to participation in TARGET .

( ii ) the settlement of the euro leg of foreign exchange operations involving the Eurosystem ; and ( iii ) the settlement of cross-border large-value netting systems handling euro transfers shall be effected through TARGET .
Other payments may also be effected through TARGET .
2 . A national RTGS system and the ECB payment mechanism shall not process a payment order unless sufficient funds are available on the account of the sending participant with the sending NCB / ECB , either through immediately available funds already credited to that account , through the intraday mobilisation of reserves maintained to fulfil reserve requirements or through intraday credit granted by such NCB / ECB , as the case may be , to that participant in accordance with Article 3 ( f ) .
RTGS rules and the rules for the ECB payment mechanism shall specify the point in time at which payment orders become irrevocable , which must not be later than the point in time at which the RTGS account of the sending participant held at the sending NCB / ECB is debited with the amount concerned .
Where national RTGS systems apply a blocking-of-funds procedure before debiting the RTGS account , such irrevocability shall be provided from that earlier point in time at which blocking takes place .
( f ) I n t r a d a y c r e d i t 1 .
Subject to the provisions of this Guideline , each NCB shall provide intraday credit to the supervised credit institutions referred to in Article 3 ( a ) participating in the national RTGS system of such NCB provided that any such credit institution is an eligible counterparty for Eurosystem monetary policy operations and has access to the marginal lending facility , except if such credit institution 's access to intraday credit has been suspended further to the procedures as set out in this Guideline .
Provided that it is a clear condition that intraday credit shall remain limited to the day in question and that no 2005O0016 --- EN --- 01.01.2007 --- 001.001 --- 9 â¼B extension to overnight credit shall be possible , intraday credit may also be granted to : ( i ) treasury departments referred to in Article 3 ( a )( 1 )( i ) ;
( iii ) investment firms referred to in Article 3 ( a )( 1 )( iii ) , on condition that any such investment firm submits satisfactory written evidence that : ( a ) either it has concluded a formal agreement with a Eurosystem monetary policy counterparty to cover any residual debit position at the end of the day in question ; or ( b ) access to intraday credit is limited to investment firms which hold an account with a central securities depository , and the investment firm in question is subject to a liquidity deadline or the amount of intraday credit is subject to a ceiling .
Should an investment firm for any reason be unable to reimburse the intraday credit on time , it shall be subject to penalties set in accordance with the following .
If such an investment firm has a debit balance on its RTGS account as at the close of business of TARGET for the first time within any 12-month period , then the following shall apply . The relevant NCB shall promptly impose a penalty on that participant calculated at a rate five percentage points above the marginal lending rate on the amount of such debit balance .
Should such an investment firm repeatedly be in such a debit position , then the penalty interest rate applied to that participant would be increased by a further 2,5 percentage points each time such a debit position were to occur within the 12month period referred to above ; ( iv ) supervised credit institutions referred to in Article 3 ( a )( 1 ) , which are not eligible counterparties for Eurosystem monetary policy operations and / or do not have access to the marginal lending facility .
All provisions of the penalty regime set out in Article 3 ( f )( 1 )( iii ) for investment firms shall apply identically to such credit institutions when , for any reason , they are unable to reimburse the intraday credit on time ; ( v ) organisations providing clearing or settlement services ( and subject to oversight by a competent authority ) on condition that the arrangements for granting intraday credit to such organisations are submitted in advance to the Governing Council of the ECB for approval .
2 . Each NCB shall provide intraday credit by means of collateralised intraday overdrafts at the NCB and / or intraday repurchase transactions with NCBs in compliance with the criteria laid down below and with the further minimum common features that the Governing Council of the ECB may specify from time to time .
3 . Intraday credit shall be based on adequate collateral .
Collateral shall be the same assets and instruments and be subject to the same valuation and risk control rules as those prescribed for eligible assets for monetary policy operations .
Except for treasury departments and public sector bodies referred to respectively in Article 3 ( a )( 1 )( i ) and ( ii ) , an NCB shall not accept as underlying assets debt instruments issued or guaranteed by the participant , or by any other entity with which the counterparty has close links , as defined in the General Documentation on Eurosystem Monetary Policy Instruments and procedures and applied for monetary policy operations .
2005O0016 --- EN --- 01.01.2007 --- 001.001 --- 10 â¼B 4 . The Governing Council of the ECB may exempt treasury departments , referred to in Article 3 ( a )( 1 )( i ) , from the requirement of collateralisation in relation to the provision of intraday credit set out in Article 3 ( f )( 3 ) upon a proposal from the relevant NCB .
5 . Intraday credit provided in accordance with Article 3 ( f ) shall be free of interest .
6 . Intraday credit shall not be granted to any remote participant .
7 . RTGS rules shall contain the grounds on the basis of which an NCB may suspend or terminate a participant 's access to intraday credit .
Where an NCB decides to suspend or terminate the access of a counterparty that is eligible for Eurosystem monetary policy operations , the ECB shall approve such decision before it becomes effective .
As an exception and under urgent circumstances , an NCB may suspend such monetary policy counterparty 's access to intraday credit with immediate effect .
In this case the NCB concerned shall immediately notify the ECB of such action in writing and the ECB shall have the power to reverse the NCB 's decision .
If the NCB does not receive the ECB 's decision within ten operating days of the ECB 's receipt of notification , however , then the ECB shall be deemed to have approved the NCB 's decision .
In case of automatic suspension or termination clauses ( i.e. automatic events of default for insolvency or similar measures ) the NCB concerned shall immediately notify the ECB in writing .
The grounds for such suspension or termination shall cover any event which entails systemic risk or which could otherwise endanger the smooth operation of payment systems , including : ( i ) where a participant enters into insolvency proceedings ; ( ii ) where a participant is in breach of the RTGS rules in question ;
( iii ) where the entitlement of a participant to participate in the national RTGS system is suspended or terminated ; and ( iv ) where , in case of a participant which is an eligible counterparty for Eurosystem monetary policy operations , the participant ceases to be eligible or is excluded or suspended from access to any or all such operations .

Article 8 TARGET Compensation Scheme 1 .
General principles ( a ) In the event of a malfunctioning of TARGET , direct and indirect participants ( for the purposes of this Article hereinafter referred to as Â« TARGET participants ') shall be entitled to submit claims for compensation in accordance with the rules laid down in this Article .
( b ) The TARGET Compensation Scheme shall apply to all national RTGS systems ( regardless of whether such RTGS systems are connected to TARGET via interlinking or through a bilateral link ) and to the ECB payment mechanism and shall be available for all TARGET participants ( including TARGET participants in 2005O0016 --- EN --- 01.01.2007 --- 001.001 --- 16 â¼B national RTGS systems of participating Member States that are not counterparties to the Eurosystem monetary policy operations , and TARGET participants in national RTGS systems of non-participating Member States ) in relation to all TARGET payments ( without distinguishing between domestic payments and crossborder payments ) .
The TARGET Compensation Scheme shall not apply to customers in the ECB payment mechanism in accordance with the Terms and Conditions governing the use of the ECB payment mechanism , which are available on the ECB 's website and are updated from time to time .
( c ) Unless otherwise decided by the Governing Council of the ECB , the TARGET Compensation Scheme shall not apply where the malfunctioning of TARGET is caused by : ( i ) external events beyond the control of the ESCB ; or ( ii ) the failure of a third party other than the operator of the national RTGS system where the malfunctioning occurred .
( ca ) For the purposes of Article 8 ( 1 )( c )( ii ) , a service-providing NCB shall not be regarded as a third party .
( d ) Offers under the TARGET Compensation Scheme ( compensation offers ) shall be the only compensation offered by the ESCB in cases of a malfunctioning .
However , the acceptance of a compensation offer by a TARGET participant shall constitute its irrevocable agreement that it thereby waives all claims ( including any claims for consequential damages ) it may have against any member of the ESCB , in accordance with national laws or otherwise , and that the receipt by it of the corresponding compensation payment shall be in full and final settlement of all such claims .
The TARGET participant shall indemnify the ESCB up to the amount received under the TARGET Compensation Scheme from any further compensation which might be claimed by any other TARGET participant concerning the respective payment order .
( f ) If a connected NCB cannot process cross-border payments due to a malfunctioning of the service-providing NCB 's RTGS system , the service-providing NCB shall be regarded as the Â« malfunctioning NCB Â» , meaning the NCB of the national RTGS system where the malfunctioning occurred , in relation to such payments .
( a ) With respect to a sending TARGET participant , a claim for an administration fee and interest compensation shall be considered if due to a malfunctioning : ( i ) the same day processing of a payment order was not completed ; or ( ii ) such TARGET participant can show that it had the intention to enter a payment order into TARGET but was unable to do so due to a stop-sending status of a national RTGS system .
( b ) With respect to a receiving TARGET participant , a claim for an administration fee shall be considered if due to a malfunctioning such TARGET participant did not receive a TARGET payment that it was expecting to receive on the day of malfunctioning . In this event a claim for interest compensation shall also be considered if :
2005O0016 --- EN --- 01.01.2007 --- 001.001 --- 17 â¼B ( i ) such TARGET participant had recourse to the marginal lending facility or , if a TARGET participant does not have access to the marginal lending facility , such TARGET participant was left with a debit balance or had a spill-over from intraday credit into overnight credit on its RTGS account at the close of business of TARGET or had to borrow amounts from the respective NCB ; and ( ii ) either the malfunctioning NCB was the receiving NCB , or the malfunctioning occurred so late in the TARGET operating day that it was technically impossible or impracticable for the receiving TARGET participant to have recourse to the money market .
Calculation of compensation
3.1 . Compensation of sending TARGET participants ( a ) The compensation offer under the TARGET Compensation Scheme shall consist of an administration fee only or an administration fee and interest compensation .
( b ) The administration fee shall be determined at EUR 50 for the first payment order not completed on the processing date , and , in case of multiple adjustments , EUR 25 for each of the next four such payment orders and EUR 12,50 for each further such payment order .
( c ) The interest compensation shall be determined by applying the rate ( the reference rate ) , from day-to-day whichever is the lower of the EONIA rate ( the euro overnight index average ) and the marginal lending rate , to the amount of the payment order not processed as a result of a malfunctioning for each day in the period starting on the date of the entering or the intended entering of the payment order into TARGET and ending on the date that the payment order was or could have been successfully completed ( the period of malfunctioning ) .
When calculating the interest compensation , the proceeds of any actual use of funds by having recourse to the deposit facility ( or , in the case of TARGET participants in national RTGS systems of participating Member States that are not counterparties to the Eurosystem monetary policy operations , the remuneration received on excess funds in the settlement account , or , in the case of TARGET participants in national RTGS systems of non-participating Member States , the remuneration received for incurring additional positive end-of-day balances on the RTGS account ) shall be deducted from the amount of compensation .
( e ) With respect to sending TARGET participants in national RTGS systems of non-participating Member States , any limit to the remuneration on the aggregate amount of overnight deposits on the RTGS accounts of such TARGET participants shall be disregarded to the extent that such amount can be attributed to the malfunctioning .
3.2 . Compensation of receiving TARGET participants ( a ) The compensation offer under the TARGET Compensation Scheme shall consist of an administration fee only or an administration fee and interest compensation .
( b ) The amount of the administration fee shall be as determined under paragraph 3.1 ( b ) and the administration fee shall be determined by reference to each sending TARGET participant .
( c ) The calculation method for the interest compensation as referred to in paragraph 3.1 ( c ) above shall apply , except that the interest compensation shall be based on the difference between the 2005O0016 --- EN --- 01.01.2007 --- 001.001 --- 18 â¼B marginal lending rate and the reference rate , and shall be calculated on the amount of the recourse to the marginal lending facility as a result of the malfunctioning .
( d ) With respect to receiving TARGET participants in ( i ) national RTGS systems of participating Member States that are not counterparties to the Eurosystem monetary policy operations , and ( ii ) national RTGS systems of non-participating Member States , to the extent that a debit balance or a spill-over from intraday credit into overnight credit or the need to borrow amounts from the respective NCB can be attributed to the malfunctioning , that part of the applicable penalty rate ( as stipulated by the applicable RTGS rules in such cases ) which is above the marginal lending rate , shall be waived ( and disregarded in future cases of spill-over ) and for TARGET participants in national RTGS systems referred to in ( ii ) above , it shall be ignored for the purpose of access to intraday credit and / or continued participation in the national RTGS system concerned .
( b ) TARGET participants shall submit their claim form ( s ) to the NCB where the RTGS account that has or should have been debited or credited is maintained ( the home NCB ) within two weeks of the date of the malfunctioning .
( c ) The Governing Council of the ECB carries out the assessment of all claims received and decide whether compensation offers shall be made .
Unless otherwise decided by the Governing Council of the ECB and communicated to the TARGET participants , such assessment shall be made no later than twelve weeks after the malfunctioning .
If the assessment comprises a compensation offer , the TARGET participants concerned shall , within four weeks of the communication of such offer , either reject the offer or accept it in respect of each payment order comprised within each claim by signing a standard letter of acceptance ( the content and form of which shall be as determined and made public by the ECB from time to time ) .
There shall be no interest payable on any compensation payment .
Article 9 Force majeure There shall be no liability on the part of the NCBs / ECB for noncompliance with this Guideline to the extent that , and for so long as , 2005O0016 --- EN --- 01.01.2007 --- 001.001 --- 19 â¼B there is an inability to perform the obligations in question under the Guideline , or such obligations are subject to suspension or delay , owing to the occurrence of any event arising from any reason or cause beyond reasonable control ( including , but not limited to , equipment failure or malfunction , acts of God , natural disasters , strikes or labour disputes ) , provided that the above shall not prejudice the responsibility to have in place the back-up facilities required by this Guideline , to carry out the error-handling procedures , referred to in Articles 4 ( f ) and 4a ( d ) , as far as possible despite the force majeure event , and to use all reasonable efforts to mitigate the effects of any such event while it is taking place .
Article 10 Resolution of operational or technical disputes Without prejudice to the rights and prerogatives of the Governing Council of the ECB , any operational or technical disputes arising between NCBs or between any NCB and the ECB in connection with TARGET which cannot be settled by agreement between the parties involved in the dispute shall be notified to the Governing Council of the ECB and referred for conciliation to the PSSC .
Article 10a Applicable law In the event of any dispute arising between NCBs or between any NCB and the ECB in connection with TARGET , the respective rights and obligations to one another in relation to payment orders processed through TARGET and all other matters referred to in this Guideline shall be determined : ( i ) by the rules and procedures laid down in this Guideline ; and ( ii ) as a supplementary source in disputes concerning cross-border payments via interlinking , by the law of the Member State where the seat of the receiving NCB / ECB is located .

A cut-off time for customer payments ( both domestic and crossborder ( 1 ) of one hour before the normal TARGET closing time will apply ;
the remaining time will be used only for interbank payments ( both domestic and cross-border ( 2 ) to transfer liquidity between participants .
( 1 ) The cut-off time for cross-border customer payments sent from a participant in a connected NCB 's RTGS system via a service-providing NCB is 16.52 : 30 .

They also have a number of prominent security features , which make them easy to distinguish from counterfeits without using special equipment and which act as a deterrent to counterfeiters .
Counterfeit Analysis Centre
The ECB closely monitors advances in printing and reproduction technologies , as well as the number of counterfeits seized .
The counterfeits are analysed by the central banks of the euro area and the ECB 's Counterfeit Analysis Centre , which coordinates technical and statistical information on counterfeits .
The information stored in the centre 's database is shared with national police forces and other bodies involved in combating counterfeiting .
The ECB also works closely with Europol ( the European Police Office ) , which has been designated as the central office for coordinating the protection of the euro , as well as with Interpol ( the International Criminal Police Organization ) and the European Commission .
Preventing illegal use of digital banknote images
Anti-counterfeiting technologies , supported by the Central Bank Counterfeit Deterrence Group ( CBCDG ) of 10 of the world 's major banknote issuing authorities , deter digital counterfeiting and , by preventing the production of counterfeit banknotes , reduce the losses to individuals and business that might receive them .
The counterfeit deterrence system consists of anti-counterfeiting technologies that prevent personal computers and digital imaging tools from capturing or reproducing the image of a protected banknote . It prevents the unauthorised reproduction of banknotes .
For legitimate purposes , however , high-resolution images of banknotes are available from the ECB .
To maintain and enhance the euro 's integrity as a global currency , the ECB also manages , coordinates and funds banknote research and development activities .

20 July 2007 - Â« SEPA : from concept to reality Â» ( fifth progress report )
In its fifth progress report on the Single Euro Payments Area ( SEPA ) , which is being published today , the Governing Council of the ECB focuses on giving guidance to the market in those areas in which greater efforts are needed in order to make the SEPA project a success .
The SEPA project has now entered a critical phase , as its official launch in January 2008 is only a few months away .
The Eurosystem greatly appreciates the work already done by the European banking industry , through the European Payments Council ( EPC ) , to make SEPA a reality .
However , continued efforts , not only by the banks , but by all stakeholders ( such as corporate entities , public administrations , national banking communities and merchants ) will be necessary to ensure that the project becomes a success .
This progress report therefore focuses on how Â« gaps Â» in delivery of the SEPA project might be addressed , whether short-term problems might simply hamper the timely start of SEPA in January 2008 , or whether longer-term problems could have a negative impact on its sustained success .
In this respect , particular attention should be paid to providing clarity on all features of direct debits , addressing the need for at least one additional European debit card scheme and ensuring the reachability of banks .
The key conclusions of this report should now be addressed by the market so as to ensure that SEPA becomes a lasting success .
The report , which is being published in English today , will be available in other official Community languages in due course .

Having regard to the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank , and in particular to Article 19.1 thereof , Having regard to Council Regulation ( EC ) No 2531/98 of 23 November 1998 concerning the application of minimum reserves by the European Central Bank ( 1 ) , as amended by Regulation ( EC ) No 134/2002 ( 2 ) , and in particular to Article 2 thereof , Whereas : Regulation ( EC ) No 2818/98 of the European Central Bank of 1 December 1998 on the application of minimum reserves ( ECB / 1998/15 ) ( 3 ) , as amended by Regulation ( EC ) No 1921 / 2000 ( ECB / 2000/8 ) ( 4 ) , should be amended for the following reasons : ( 1 )
It is necessary for the automatic exemption procedure in the event of winding-up proceedings to apply without prejudice to the possibility of applying for an exemption under Article 2 ( 2 ) of Regulation ( EC ) No 2818/98 ( ECB / 1998/15 ) for the purposes of specific features of national procedures .
It is necessary to expressly clarify the obligation to include in the reserve base the liabilities of an institution vis-Ã -vis a branch of the same entity , or vis-Ã -vis the head office or registered office of the same entity , which are located outside participating Member States .
The possibility of the Eurosystem conducting in parallel more than one main refinancing operation , with such operations having different maturities , requires an amendment to the formula concerning the calculation of the remuneration of holdings of required reserves ,
Directive 2000/28 / EC ( 5 ) extended the definition of credit institutions contained in Article 1 , point 1 , first subparagraph , of Directive 2000/12 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 March 2000 relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions ( 6 ) to electronic money institutions .
In order to clarify that electronic money institutions will be subject to minimum reserve requirements for reasons of equal treatment between the various categories of electronic money issuers , the reference to the definition of credit institutions contained in Article 2 ( 1 ) of Regulation ( EC ) No 2818/98 ( ECB / 1998/15 ) should be amended accordingly .
Pursuant to Article 2 ( 2 ) of Regulation ( EC ) No 2818/98 ( ECB / 1998/15 ) , the ECB may exempt institutions which are subject to winding-up proceedings from reserve requirements on a non-discriminatory basis .
It is appropriate for reasons of efficiency to establish a general rule according to which credit institutions will be automatically exempted from reserve requirements for the whole maintenance period within which they cease to exist as such .

( b ) In paragraph 2 ( a ) , the words Â« winding-up proceedings or Â» are deleted . 3 .
The following sentence is inserted at the end of paragraph 1 of Article 3 : Â« If an institution has liabilities vis-Ã -vis a branch of the same entity , or vis-Ã -vis the head office or registered office of the same entity , which are located outside participating Member States , it shall include such liabilities in the reserve base .'
Article 8 ( 1 ) is replaced by the following : Â« 1 .
Holdings of required reserves are remunerated at the average , taken over the maintenance period , of the ESCB 's rate ( weighted according to the number of calendar days ) for the main refinancing operations according to the following formula ( whereby the result is rounded to the nearest cent ) : i = MRi =

The fourth indent of Article 105 ( 2 ) of the Treaty and the fourth indent of Article 3.1 of the Statute empower the European Central Bank ( ECB ) and the national central banks ( NCBs ) to promote the smooth operation of payment systems .
Article 22 of the Statute entrusts the ECB and the NCBs with the provision of facilities to ensure efficient and sound clearing and payment systems within the Community and with other countries . The achievement of a single monetary policy entails the need for payment arrangements through which the monetary policy operations between NCBs and credit institutions can be effected in a timely and secure manner , and which will foster the singleness of the money market within the euro area .

C 116/11
EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK OPINION OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK of 4 May 2005 at the request of the Council of the European Union on a proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation ( EC ) No 3605/93 as regards the quality of statistical data in the context of the excessive deficit procedure ( COM ( 2005 ) 71 final ) ( CON / 2005/11 ) ( 2005 / C 116/08 ) 1 .
On 15 April 2005 , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) received a request from the Council of the European Union for an opinion on a proposal for a Council regulation amending Regulation ( EC ) No 3605/93 as regards the quality of statistical data in the context of the excessive deficit procedure ( hereinafter the Â« proposed regulation ') .
The proposed regulation amends Council Regulation ( EC ) No 3605/93 of 22 November 1993 on the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community ( 1 ) .
The objective of the proposed regulation is to improve the quality of the government accounts to be used for the application of the Protocol on the excessive deficit procedure ( EDP ) , in particular government deficit and debt data ( hereinafter Â« EDP data ') .
The proposed regulation obliges Member States to provide detailed inventories of the methods , procedures and sources used for the compilation of their government accounts , and both to inform the Commission ( Eurostat ) of any significant revision to the actual and planned government deficit and debt data that have already been reported and to document any significant revision to the actual government deficit and debt data that have already been reported .
The proposed regulation further provides that the assessment of the quality of EDP data , including the underlying government accounts , shall be the responsibility of the Commission ( Eurostat ) , which will carry out in-depth monitoring visits in the Member States , in addition to its dialogue visits , in order to monitor the government accounts reported and the underlying data compilation processes .
The proposed regulation requires Member States to cooperate with visiting officials , to publish the government accounts reported for past years and to certify that these accounts comply with the principles established by Article 10 of Council Regulation ( EC ) No 322/97 of 17 February 1997 on Community Statistics ( 2 ) , and to request clarification from the Commission ( Eurostat ) on the correct accounting treatment of government transactions in case of doubt .
The proposed regulation also recognises the right of the Commission ( Eurostat ) to express reservations on the quality of the government accounts reported and to amend such data .
The ECB welcomes the core objective of the proposed regulation , which is intended to strengthen the legal framework for compiling government accounts underlying the EDP and to provide a legal basis for the Code of best practice on the compilation and reporting of data in the context of the excessive deficit procedure , adopted by the Council of Ministers ( ECOFIN ) on 18 February 2003 .

C 116/12
B. Specific remarks 5 .
The ECB notes that the proposed amendments do not change the current spring and autumn reporting deadlines for government accounts .
The ECB would support deferring the reporting deadlines by one month , to 31 March and 30 September respectively , as this may improve the overall quality of government accounts , in particular government deficit data .
Such deferral would increase the availability of source data in spring and align EDP data with the complete set of European System of Accounts ( ESA ) 95 ( 1 ) government accounts , thus enabling the Commission ( Eurostat ) to carry out detailed quality checks .
In addition , it would also enable statistical authorities to meet their obligations to compile budgetary data by giving them more time to complete the transition from the public accounts provided by various government bodies to the ESA 95 data required for EDP purposes .
The ECB also supports specifying in a relevant regulation , by reference to ESA 95 , a complete set of actual government accounts to be provided by the Member States to the Commission ( Eurostat ) , including sufficient breakdowns .
It would also be useful to require Member States to provide any necessary reconciliation between EDP and ESA 95 data .
The ECB would furthermore support publication by the Commission ( Eurostat ) of complete sets of government accounts by Member State and related formal quality reports .

Amended proposal for a EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND COUNCIL DIRECTIVE amending Directive 85/611 / EEC on the coordination of laws , regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities - ( UCITS ) /* COM / 94/329 FINAL COD 453 */ Official Journal C 242 , 30/08/1994 P. 0005
Amended proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive amending Directive 85/611 / EEC on the coordination of laws , regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities ( Ucits ) ( 94 / C 242/06 ) ( Text with EEA relevance ) COM ( 94 ) 329 final COD 453 ( Submitted by the Commission pursuant to Article 189a ( 2 ) of the EC Treaty on 20 July 1994 ) THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION , Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community , and in particular Article 57 ( 2 ) thereof , Having regard to the proposal from the Commission ( 1 ) , Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee ( 2 ) , 1 . Whereas the scope of Council Directive 85/611 / EEC was confined initially to collective investment undertakings of the open-end type which promote the sale of their units to the public in the Community and the sole object of which is investment in transferable securities ;
whereas it was envisaged in the preamble to Directive 85/611 / EEC that undertakings falling outside its scope would be the subject of coordination at a later stage ;
Whereas money market funds , cash funds , funds of Ucits and master-feeder funds , [.
] given their operational features and investment objectives , may be regarded as very close to Ucits ;
whereas it is desirable to bring these funds within the scope of Directive 85/611 / EEC since [.
] European Union and such coordination is necessary to bring about a European capital market ;
3 . Whereas the inclusion of money market funds is achieved by allowing Ucits to invest freely in money market instruments while preserving the guarantees necessary to give adequate protection to investors ;
whereas money market instruments cover those classes of transferable instruments which are normally dealt in on the money market , for example treasury and local authority bills , certificates of deposit , commercial paper and bankers Â» acceptances ;
whereas Member States should have the option of choosing the list of eligible money market instruments on the basis of objective criteria to take account of the existing structural differences in the money markets of different countries ;
4 . Whereas , to take market developments into account , it is desirable that the investment object of Ucits is widened in order to permit them [.
. ] to invest in banking deposits ;
5 . Whereas only Ucits investing solely in units issued by other Ucits ( fund of Ucits ) may be brought within the scope of Directive 85/611 / EEC ;
whereas a Fund of Ucits may be identified on the basis of the number of Ucits in which it can invest ;
whereas the requirement of risk spreading for funds of Ucits is indirectly respected since funds of Ucits can only invest in units issued by Ucits complying with the risk spreading criteria of the Directive ;
whereas , while it is acceptable in certain circumstances for Ucits to invest in another Ucits , it is important that a fund of Ucits ensures investors an adequate degree of disclosure on the costs they incur ; 5a .
Whereas it is also appropriate to include in the scope of Directive 85/611 / EEC funds having a master fund / feeder fund structure in so far as they constitute a single entity , affording investors the same safeguards as do traditional Ucits ;
Whereas it is appropriate that , except for explicitly mentioned exemptions , the rules laid down for the authorization , supervision , structure and activities of Ucits and for the information to be published should also apply to [. .
] the funds now brought within the scope of Directive 85/611 / EEC ; 7 .
Whereas , for prudential reasons , Ucits should avoid assuming an excessive concentration of banking deposits to a single credit institution ;
8 . Whereas many directives have been adopted in the financial field in recent years ;
whereas it seems therefore advisable to bring some Articles of Directive 85/611 / EEC more in line with existing provisions of Community legislation ;
9 . Whereas Council Directive 89/646 / EEC and Directive 93/22 / EEC ( Investment Services Directive ) provided the basis for the single licence to supply financial services to credit institutions and investment firms respectively ;
whereas Member States should not therefore restrict the freedom of Ucits to choose a depositary established in another Member State and authorized under the above Directives .
10 . Whereas it is desirable to make the depositary function accessible to institutions and firms of third countries ;
whereas it is essential to provide that the rules applied to such firms may not be more favourable than those for branches of institutions and firms from another Member State ;
11 . Whereas Article 21 of Directive 85/611 / EEC contains the rules under which Ucits are allowed to use derivative instruments ;
whereas it is necessary for the protection of investors to provide for a harmonized framework by introducing a maximum quantitative ceiling for the utilization of financial derivatives ;
whereas , considering the new portfolio management techniques which have developed in recent years , it is desirable that Ucits may use , in compliance with the above quantitative limit , financial futures and options for the purpose of adjusting their portfolio 's composition on a temporary basis ;
12 . Whereas the current limit of 5 % concerning the possibility for Ucits of investing in other Ucits proved to be too stringent in certain markets ;
13 . Whereas Article 25 ( 1 ) of Directive 85/611 / EEC envisaged a coordination of the concept of significant influence at a later stage ;
whereas , given the result achieved in this field in other directives , it is desirable to define significant influence in terms of a quantitative limit ;
14 . Whereas it is appropriate to favour the reduction of costs related to translation of documents in the cross-border marketing without impairing the degree of investor protection ;
15 . Whereas technical adaptations to the rules laid down in this Directive may from time to time be necessary to take new developments in the investment funds field into account ;
whereas it is desirable to set a general criterion to define the technical nature of modifications ;
whereas it is important that these technical modifications should be adopted in accordance with the procedure established in Directive .
/ EEC , HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE : Article 1 In Directive 85/611 / EEC as amended by Directive 88/220 / EEC the following amendments are made : - Amendment No 1 In Article 1 , paragraph 2 shall be replaced by the following : Â« 2 .

11 November 2010 - Monthly Bulletin
Based on its regular economic and monetary analyses , the Governing Council continues to view the current key ECB interest rates as appropriate .
It therefore decided to leave them unchanged .
Taking into account all the new information and analyses which have become available since its meeting on 7 October 2010 , the Governing Council continues to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon .
Recent economic data are consistent with the Governing Council 's assessment that the underlying momentum of the recovery remains positive .
At the same time , uncertainty is prevailing .
The monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained .
The stance , the provision of liquidity and the allotment modes will be adjusted as appropriate , taking into account the fact that all the non-standard measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions are fully consistent with the ECB 's mandate and , by construction , temporary in nature .
Turning to the economic analysis , recent data releases and survey evidence generally confirm that the positive underlying momentum of the economic recovery in the euro area remains in place .
In line with previous expectations , this implies ongoing real GDP growth in the second half of this year .
The global recovery is expected to proceed , and this should imply a continued positive impact on the demand for euro area exports .
At the same time , private sector domestic demand should contribute to growth , supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system .
However , the recovery in activity is expected to be dampened by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors .
In the Governing Council 's assessment , the risks to this economic outlook are still slightly tilted to the downside , with uncertainty prevailing .
On the one hand , global trade may continue to grow more rapidly than expected , thereby supporting euro area exports .
On the other hand , some concerns remain relating to the re-emergence of tensions in financial markets .
In addition , downside risks relate to renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices , protectionist pressures , and the possibility of a disorderly correction of global imbalances .
With regard to price developments , as anticipated , euro area annual HICP inflation rose to 1.9% in October , according to Eurostat 's flash estimate , compared with 1.8% in September .
In the next few months HICP inflation rates will hover around current levels before moderating again in the course of next year .
Overall , in 2011 inflation rates should remain moderate .
Risks to the outlook for price developments are slightly tilted to the upside . They relate , in particular , to the evolution of energy and non-oil commodity prices .
Furthermore , increases in indirect taxation and administered prices may be greater than currently expected , owing to the need for fiscal consolidation in the coming years .
At the same time , risks to domestic price and cost developments are still expected to be contained .
Turning to the monetary analysis , the annual growth rate of M3 was broadly unchanged , at 1.0% in September 2010 , after 1.1% in August .
The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector , at 1.2% , remained unchanged from August .
Looking beyond developments in individual months , broad money and loan growth remains low and continues to support the assessment that the underlying pace of monetary expansion is moderate and that inflationary pressures over the medium term are contained .
The annual growth rate of M1 has continued to moderate , standing at 5.9% in September 2010 , while the annual growth rate of other short-term deposits has become less negative . This reflects the widening spread between interest rates paid on short-term time deposits and those paid on overnight deposits .
The annual growth rate of bank loans to the private sector is increasingly supported by the flow of loans to non-financial corporations .
The annual growth rate of these loans is still slightly negative , but developments in recent months suggest that a turning point was reached earlier in 2010 . This would be consistent with the lagged response of loan developments to economic activity over the business cycle that was also observed in past cycles .
The annual growth rate of loans to households stood at 2.8% in September and thereby remained at levels seen in previous months .
Banks have continued to gradually increase the weight of credit to the private sector in the overall size of their balance sheets , but the challenge remains to expand the availability of such credit when demand picks up further .
Taking into account all the new information and analyses which have become available since its meeting on 7 October 2010 , the Governing Council continues to expect price developments to remain moderate over the policy-relevant medium-term horizon .
A cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that inflationary pressures over the medium term remain contained .
Turning to fiscal policies , there is a clear need to strengthen public confidence in the capacity of governments to return to sustainable public finances , reduce risk premia in interest rates and thus support sustainable growth over the medium term .
To this end , it is essential that countries pursue credible multi-year consolidation plans and fully implement the planned consolidation measures .
In their 2011 budgets , they need to specify credible fiscal adjustment measures , focusing on the expenditure side .
Any positive fiscal developments that may emerge , reflecting factors such as a more favourable than expected environment , should be exploited to make faster progress with fiscal consolidation .
Major reforms are particularly necessary in those countries that have experienced a loss of competitiveness in the past or that are suffering from high fiscal and external deficits .
Increasing product market competition , particularly in the services sectors , would also facilitate the restructuring of the economy and encourage innovation and the adoption of new technologies .
At their meeting on 28-29 October 2010 the Heads of State and Government of the European Union agreed on the reform of the EU 's economic governance .
The proposals put forward by President Van Rompuy represent a strengthening of the existing framework for fiscal and macroeconomic surveillance in the EU .
However , the Governing Council considers that they do not go as far as the quantum leap in the economic governance of Monetary Union that it has been calling for .
In particular , the Governing Council is concerned that there would be insufficient automaticity in the implementation of fiscal surveillance , that there is no specification of the rule to reduce the government debt ratio , and that financial sanctions have not been explicitly retained under the macroeconomic surveillance procedure .
With regard to the macroeconomic surveillance procedure in particular , the new system of mutual surveillance would need to concentrate firmly on euro area countries experiencing sustained losses of competitiveness and large current account deficits .
It should be determined by transparent and effective trigger mechanisms .
It would be essential that the assessments of macroeconomic imbalances and recommendations for corrective action be given broad publicity at all stages of the surveillance process .
The public and the markets can be confident that the Governing Council remains firmly committed to delivering on its mandate of maintaining price stability over the medium term .

11 May 2006 - Monthly Bulletin
At its meeting on 4 May 2006 , on the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses , the Governing Council decided to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged .
Overall , the information which has become available since the previous meeting on 2 April broadly confirms the Governing Council 's earlier assessment of the outlook for price developments and economic activity in the euro area , and that monetary and credit growth remains very dynamic .
Against this background , the Governing Council will exercise strong vigilance in order to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise .
Such vigilance is particularly warranted in a context of ample liquidity and still very low levels of nominal and real interest rates across the whole maturity spectrum , implying an overall accommodative monetary policy stance .
For monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting growth and employment in the euro area , inflation expectations must be firmly anchored .
Turning first to the economic analysis , the data that have become available since the start of the year point to a re-acceleration of economic growth in the first quarter of 2006 , following the moderation observed in the last quarter of 2005 .
In addition , the latest indicators and survey information point to continued growth in the second quarter and lend support to the scenario of a gradual broadening of economic activity as embodied in the March 2006 ECB staff projections .
Business confidence is particularly buoyant , which , in principle , bodes well for investment , and the recovery in consumption and employment appears to be proceeding , albeit still gradually .
Looking further ahead , the conditions remain in place for continued growth over the coming quarters .
Activity in the world economy is expected to remain strong , providing continued support for euro area exports .
Investment growth should benefit from an extended period of very favourable financing conditions , balance sheet restructuring , and gains in earnings and business efficiency .
Consumption growth should also strengthen over time , in line with developments in real disposable income , as the labour market situation continues to improve .
This favourable outlook for economic growth is broadly in line with available forecasts from international organisations and the private sector .
Considering the information available , risks to this scenario appear broadly balanced over the shorter term , although recently oil prices have again demonstrated high volatility and their potential for posing downside risks to growth .
This underlines the need for further improvement in the transparency of oil markets and further investment in this sector .
Concerns about global imbalances continue to prevail over longer horizons , as do risks relating to protectionism .
With regard to price developments , according to Eurostat 's flash estimate , annual HICP inflation was 2.4% in April 2006 , compared with 2.2% in March and 2.3% in February .
In the short term , annual inflation rates are likely to remain above 2 %, with the month-to-month profile largely dependent on developments in oil prices and the strength of their pass-through to other prices along the production chain .
Beyond the short term , changes in administered prices and indirect taxes are expected to affect inflation significantly in 2007 and a further upward impact may also be expected from the indirect effects of past oil price increases .
At the same time , wage dynamics in the euro area have remained moderate in recent quarters and wage growth is expected to remain contained , partly reflecting global competitive pressures , particularly in the manufacturing sector .
Recent wage moderation has helped to dampen domestic inflationary pressures .
Looking ahead , it is equally crucial that the social partners continue to meet their responsibilities in this regard , not least with a view to fostering employment growth .
Risks to the outlook for price developments remain on the upside and include further increases in oil prices , a stronger pass-through of oil price rises into consumer prices than currently anticipated , additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes , and -- more fundamentally -- stronger wage developments than expected at present , possibly due to second-round effects stemming from past oil price increases .
Turning to the monetary analysis , in a context of ample liquidity in the euro area , monetary and credit growth remains very dynamic .
In particular , the annual growth rate of loans to the private sector has continued to increase over recent months and has now reached double-digit levels .
Credit growth has also become more broadly based across sectors , with borrowing both by households -- especially for house purchase -- and by non-financial corporations growing more strongly .
Monetary growth continues to be driven mainly by the expansion of its most liquid components .
Thus the latest developments confirm that the stimulative impact of the low level of interest rates remains the dominant factor behind the current high trend rate of monetary expansion .
Overall , further acceleration of monetary and credit growth in this environment continues to point to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term .
Monetary developments , therefore , require careful monitoring , especially in the light of the strengthening of economic activity and , in particular , of strong asset price dynamics , especially in housing markets .
To sum up , annual inflation rates are projected to remain elevated in 2006 and 2007 and the economic analysis confirms that the risks to price stability continue to lie on the upside .
Some of these risks appear to have increased in view of the renewed strength of oil prices .
Given strong money and credit growth in a context of already ample liquidity , a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis supports the assessment that upside risks to price stability prevail over the medium to longer term .
It therefore remains crucial to ensure that medium to long-term inflation expectations in the euro area are kept solidly anchored at levels consistent with price stability -- a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution to sustainable economic growth and job creation .
Accordingly , particular vigilance is of the essence in order to ensure that risks to price stability do not materialise .
With respect to fiscal policies , there are some signs that the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact and commitment to the rules have improved since last year 's revision .
However , fiscal targets in a number of cases imply a very slow pace of consolidation and their attainment is still subject to considerable risks .
The Governing Council therefore supports any further reinforcement of fiscal consolidation efforts that also takes full advantage of a more favourable economic environment .
Appropriately ambitious fiscal targets as part of a comprehensive structural reform programme would bring deficit and debt ratios down more rapidly . This is decisive in order to secure the sustainability of public finances .
Such strategies would also boost confidence in the economic prospects of the euro area .
As regards structural reforms , the Governing Council again stresses the importance of undertaking comprehensive reforms to ensure open , competitive and well-functioning labour and product markets , including the promotion of wage and price flexibility and the fostering of an attractive environment for investment and innovation .
The need for such reforms has again been highlighted by recent oil price developments , as they would enhance the resilience of the euro area economy to external shocks .
There is a broad and firm consensus that openness and flexibility are beneficial in promoting growth and employment and it is now essential to turn the agreed reform plans into actions and to strengthen them where necessary .
By pushing forward with ambitious structural reforms , euro area countries will also lend support to the ongoing economic recovery .
The first article provides an update on the ECB 's ongoing work on monitoring and assessing progress with European financial integration .
The second article describes the process of establishing a single list of collateral throughout the euro area , which will replace the current two-tier collateral system .
The third article provides an overview of the developments in equity issuance in the euro area over the last twelve years , with a particular emphasis on initial public offerings .

According to Article 32.5 of the Statute , the sum of the participating NCBs Â» monetary income shall be allocated to the participating NCBs in proportion to their paid-up shares in the capital of the ECB .
According to Articles 32.6 and 32.7 of the Statute , it is for the Governing Council of the ECB to arrange for the clearing and settlement at the ECB of the balances arising from the allocation of monetary income and to take all other measures necessary for the application of Article 32 of the Statute .
Article 10.3 of the Statute stipulates that for any decision taken under Article 32 of the Statute , the votes of the Governing Council of the ECB shall be weighted according to the NCBs Â» shares in the subscribed capital of the ECB .
Council Regulation ( EC ) No 974/98 of 3 May 1998 on the introduction of the euro ( 1 ) , in particular Articles 1 , 9 and 10 thereof , has provided for a continuation , during the transitional period ( i.e. the period between 1 January 1999 and 31 December 2001 ) , of the territorial

The calculation shall be based on accounting data reported by participating NCBs to the ECB under Guideline ECB / 2000/18 .
The sum of each participating NCB 's monetary income shall be allocated to the participating NCBs in proportion to their paid-up shares in the capital of the ECB .
Such allocation of monetary income shall take place at the end of each financial year .

The Governing Council of the ECB , in addition to approving the annual accounts of the ECB each financial year , shall decide the amount of the charge and establish the modalities for settlement of unfunded losses .
The amount of the charge shall have a maximum upper limit equivalent to the increase in the total monetary income of the ESCB that would have arisen if banknotes denominated in national currency units had been included in the liability base .
The amount of the charge of each participating NCB shall be in proportion to its key for subscription to the capital of the ECB .
This limit shall be reduced to the extent necessary to ensure that no participating NCB shall be liable for more than the total of its seigniorage income from national banknotes in circulation for the relevant financial year .
For the purposes of this paragraph , national seigniorage shall be calculated by applying the reference rate to the amount of national banknotes in circulation .
Article 5 Final provisions This Decision , as amended by Decision ECB / 2000 / NP17 , shall enter into force on 1 January 2001 .

Preliminary stages
Lucas Papademos , Vice-President of the ECB , with the three prizewinners of the architecture competition in the Deutsches Architekturmuseum , February 2004 Â© Martin Joppen
The various stages From choosing the location and starting to build , to completing the construction of the new European Central Bank ( ECB ) premises , many stages have already been completed , and many are still to come ;
all are the result of various decisions and planning procedures . Choosing the location
When the Maastricht Treaty was signed in 1992 , it was decided that the ECB would be located in Frankfurt am Main .
In 1998 , as the ECB started operations in rented offices in the Eurotower , the search for a suitable future location for the ECB in Frankfurt began .
Having looked into 35 possible sites across the city , the ECB finally decided upon the site of the former Grossmarkthalle ( wholesale fruit and vegetable market ) , including the Grossmarkthalle building itself .
A feasibility study showed that this site was economically the most viable , that it was well connected from an infrastructure point of view , that the spatial requirements could be ensured , and that it was the optimum site for fulfilling the security measures necessary for a central bank .
Furthermore , this location offers sufficient space for further construction and extension , should this become necessary in the future .
Contracts
In 2001 an urban planning framework agreement was signed between the ECB and the City of Frankfurt am Main , which set out the conditions for the transfer of the land and for the planned building developments .
In March 2002 the ECB and the City of Frankfurt am Main signed the purchase agreement for the site , and in November of the same year , an international architecture competition was launched .
The competition
The first phase of the competition , in which 80 architects were invited to participate , began in April 2003 .
On the basis of their design concepts , 12 architects were shortlisted to take part in the second phase in August 2003 .
During this phase they were requested to provide more detailed design concepts .
The jury , which met on 13 February 2004 , selected three prizewinners , who were then invited to take part in the subsequent revision phase , enabling them to make further improvements to their design concepts .
Planning phases
On 13 January 2005 the Governing Council concluded that the revised design concept of Viennese architects COOP HIMMELB ( L ) AU best met the ECB 's requirements .
At the same time the Governing Council decided to launch an optimisation phase , during which COOP HIMMELB ( L ) AU had the opportunity to further improve their design concept .
Since 2006 the project has progressed through the preliminary planning phase , which was concluded in February 2007 , the detailed planning phase , the results of which were published in October 2007 , and finally the execution planning phase , which has been under way since January 2009 .
Construction is set to commence in spring 2010 . The new premises are due to be completed by the end of 2013 and ready for occupancy in 2014 .

C 229/7
EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK OPINION OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK of 19 September 2003 at the request of the Council of the European Union on the draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe ( CON / 2003/20 ) ( 2003 / C 229/04 ) A. Introduction 1 .
On 21 July 2003 the European Central Bank ( ECB ) received a request from the Council of the European Union for an opinion on the draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe ( hereinafter the Â« draft Constitution ') .
The European Convention on the Future of Europe ( hereinafter the Â« European Convention ') adopted the draft Constitution in two steps on 13 June and 10 July 2003 and submitted it to the European Council meeting in Thessaloniki on 20 June and to the Italian Presidency on 18 July 2003 .
The European Council welcomed the draft Constitution as a good basis for starting the conference of representatives of the governments of the Member States ( Intergovernmental Conference or IGC ) that the Italian Presidency has convened for 4 October 2003 .
Furthermore , on 8 May and 5 June 2003 , the President of the ECB communicated comments and drafting suggestions to the Chairman of the European Convention on issues that concern the ECB and the ESCB .
B. General considerations 4 .
The ECB welcomes the draft Constitution , which simplifies , streamlines and clarifies the legal and institutional framework of the European Union .
It enhances the Union 's ability to act at both the European and the international level and , therefore , is an important step in preparing the Union for the future , as requested by the Laeken Declaration .
The ECB 's competence to deliver an opinion is based on Article 48 of the Treaty on European Union , which requires the consultation of the ECB in the event of institutional changes in the monetary area .
The draft Constitution amends and integrates into a single Treaty the existing Treaties on which the European Union is founded and will , upon its ratification and entry into force , be the Union 's basic primary law .
Thus , the draft Constitution , by incorporating Title VII (' Economic and monetary policy ') of the EC Treaty , addresses the legal basis of the ECB and of the European System of Central Banks ( ESCB ) , and therefore comes within the scope of Article 48 of the Treaty on European Union .
In accordance with the first sentence of Article 17.5 of the Rules of Procedure of the ECB , the Governing Council of the ECB has adopted this opinion ( 1 ) .
The ECB understands that the transfer of the provisions on the ECB and the ESCB from the EC Treaty to the Constitution will not entail any changes to the substance , and that the tasks , mandate , status and legal regime of the ECB and of the ESCB remain substantially unchanged .
Whilst the ECB attaches great value to institutional and operational stability in the monetary domain , it is also aware of the fact that a new constitution has necessary implications to the institutional framework .
The ECB considers that the adjustments and updates that the current constitutional process envisages do not affect that stability .
The ECB was neither a formal member nor an official observer of the European Convention .
Nevertheless , the President of the ECB was invited to an expert hearing of the Working Group on Economic Governance on 13 September 2002 , during which he conveyed the ECB 's preliminary views on monetary and financial matters . ( 1 ) The text of the draft Constitution on which this opinion is based is document CONV 850/03 of 18 July 2003 as released by the Secretariat of the European Convention .
The ECB has been consulted on a text that refers to , but does not have annexed to it , the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank (' the Statute ') and the other protocols which are relevant for economic and monetary union ( EMU ) .
This opinion is based on two crucial and related premises .
The first is that the substance of the Statute and the other protocols relevant to EMU will not be subject to changes and that these documents will be annexed to the Constitution of which they will form an integral part , as foreseen in Article IV-6 thereof .
The second premise is that all parts of the draft Constitution , including the Statute and the other protocols relevant to EMU , will maintain their value as primary law , i.e. the same hierarchical level as other parts of the Treaty .
C 229/8
This opinion is based on the premise that the substance of the Statute will not be changed .
Nevertheless , the ECB understands that non-substantive amendments will need to be made to the Statute , in particular to introduce terminological adaptations and cross-references to the new numbering of the Constitution provisions , and to update provisions that have become obsolete .
The ECB would wish to be associated with the preparatory activity for any such revision of the Statute .
and therefore considers that it encompasses all exclusive competences related to the euro as described in the relevant provisions of the draft Constitution , in particular Articles III-77 and III-78 .
In this opinion , the ECB identifies some Articles in the draft Constitution that are of relevance for the exercise of its functions and tasks , which would benefit from further clarifications , technical adjustments , and editorial changes .
For ease of reference , drafting suggestions are compiled in the annex to this opinion .
The status of the ECB within the Union 's institutional framework is governed by Article I-29 of the draft Constitution under which the ECB would be one of the Â« Other institutions Â» of the Union .
Article I-29 preserves the ECB 's substantive features , in particular its independence , including financial independence , legal personality and regulatory capacity , specifically the power to issue legally binding acts .
The ECB therefore understands that the framework created by the draft Constitution does not imply , and is not meant to imply , any change to the substance of the current institutional status of either the ECB or the ESCB .
C. The objectives and competences of the Union 8 .
Article I-3 ( 3 ) of the draft Constitution states that Â« The Union shall work for the sustainable development of Europe based on balanced economic growth .
Article 2 of the EC Treaty confers on the Community the task of promoting Â« non-inflationary growth Â» , and Article 4 ( 3 ) mentions Â« stable prices Â» as a Â« guiding principle Â» for the activities of both the Community and the Member States .
The ECB regrets that such an explicit reference to price stability is not contained in Article I-3 on the Union 's objectives .
Price stability yields confidence in the long-term value of the euro and translates into low and stable long-term interest rates , which in turn foster a high level of investment and , ultimately , growth and employment .
Price stability also avoids an ad hoc redistribution of wealth as a result of price increases .
Therefore , the ECB would welcome that the draft Constitution retained the current prominent positioning at the forefront of the EC Treaty of the guiding principle of stable prices , and would like to suggest that a reference to Â« non-inflationary growth Â» be introduced in Article I-3 ( 3 ) of the draft Constitution : Â« The Union shall work for the sustainable development of Europe based on balanced and non-inflationary economic growth .
Alternatively , a reference to price stability could be considered .
Article I-12 of the draft Constitution lists as an exclusive competence of the Union Â« monetary policy , for the Member States which have adopted the euro Â» .
In the context of Article I-12 the term Â« monetary policy Â» is not to be read in a narrow and technical sense as referring only to the basic task of the ESCB to which Article III-77 ( 2 )( a ) of the draft Constitution refers .
Such a narrow view is neither warranted nor intended .
Contrary to this restrictive interpretation , the ECB understands the term Â« monetary policy Â» as reflecting the title of Section 2 of Chapter II of Title III of Part III of the draft Constitution ,
The ECB notes that Article I-29 is placed under Title IV of the draft Constitution , entitled Â« The Union 's Institutions Â» .
This same heading appears in Article I-18 , where the ECB is not included .
Thus , the draft Constitution on the one hand places the ECB under the Title of Â« Union 's Institutions Â» but on the other hand the provision that lists the Union 's institutions does not include the ECB .
Because of its specific institutional features , the ECB needs to be differentiated from the Â« Union 's institutions Â» and this justifies the fact that Article I-18 does not list the ECB .
To increase the clarity , consistency and soundness of its institutional status , if not for purely editorial reasons , the ECB would like to recommend that the heading of Title IV be changed to Â« The Institutional Framework of the Union Â» ; this expression ( derived from the current heading of Chapter I of Title IV ) , would therefore encompass the constellation of institutional bodies , namely : ( i ) the Union 's institutions ( Chapter I ) , and ( ii ) the ECB , Court of Auditors and the advisory bodies ( Chapter II ) .
As a result of this the heading of Chapter I should be changed to Â« The Union 's Institutions Â» , consistently with the heading of Article I-18 in this Chapter .
By swapping the headings in this way , the ECB would be part of the Â« institutional framework of the Union Â» , without being within the list of the Â« Union 's institutions Â» .
The Union 's institutions would of course also be part of the Â« institutional framework of the Union Â» .
In addition , Article I-29 on the ECB also deals extensively with the ESCB and may also refer to the Eurosystem if the suggestion in paragraph 14 below were to be followed .
The Article defines the concept of the ESCB / Eurosystem , mentions their decisionmaking bodies , and refers to their objectives and tasks .
Therefore , the ECB suggests that the ESCB and the Eurosystem should be included in the heading of Article I-29 , together with the ECB .
C 229/9
The independence of the ESCB 12 .
Paragraph 3 of Article I-29 addresses the independence of the ECB , including its financial independence .
However , the national central banks ( NCBs ) of all the Member States , i.e. all the ESCB members , shall also be independent according to Article III-80 of the draft Constitution .
Thus , the ECB would welcome the introduction of a reference to the independence of the NCBs in paragraph 3 of Article I-29 .
This may be achieved by replacing the third sentence by the following sentence : Â« When exercising their powers and carrying out their tasks and duties , the ECB , the national central banks , and any member of their decisionmaking bodies shall be completely independent Â» .
As a consequence , the first sentence of paragraph 3 of Article I-29 would need to be replaced by the following wording : Â« The European Central Bank is an Institution which has legal personality and which shall be independent for its finances Â» .
in so doing to bring the Union 's institutional framework closer to the general public , the ECB would suggest that the historic reform that the draft Constitution represents would be a suitable opportunity to introduce the term Â« Eurosystem Â» into the Constitution .
This could be done in Article I-29 ( 1 ) , where the second sentence could be replaced by the following : Â« The European Central Bank , together with the national central banks of the Member States which have adopted the Union currency , the euro , shall constitute the Eurosystem .
The Eurosystem shall conduct the monetary policy of the Union Â» .
This terminological change will require a general provision indicating that Â« ESCB Â» is to be read as Â« Eurosystem Â» in those provisions of the Constitution that refer to tasks or functions related to the euro or to the Member States that have adopted the euro .
E. International representation of the euro 13 .
The ECB notes that the ECB is defined by Article I-29 ( 3 ) as Â« independent Â» while the expression Â« completely independent Â» is applied in relation to both the Commission ( Article I-25 ( 4 )) and the Court of Auditors ( Article I-30 ( 3 )) .
The ECB understands this difference in terminology as being merely linguistic and reflecting no qualitative difference between the independence of these institutions and that granted to the ECB , but would suggest for reasons of consistency that the terms be aligned .
The international representation of the euro is addressed in Articles III-90 and III-228 of the draft Constitution .
The ECB understands that the draft Constitution does not , even implicitly , deprive the ECB of its current competences based on the monetary tasks explicitly entrusted to the ESCB by the EC Treaty .
However , as the responsibilities of the ESCB are not referred to in the body of Article III-90 , it is advisable for reasons of legal clarity to add such an explicit reference .
For that purpose , the ECB suggests the insertion of a fourth paragraph in Article III-90 stating that Â« The measures adopted on the basis of this Article shall be in compliance with the allocation of powers laid down in Articles III-71 and III-77 .' Thus mirroring the language of Article 111 ( 4 ) of the EC Treaty .
The Eurosystem 14 .
Under the acronym Â« ESCB Â» two realities coexist .
On the one hand , ESCB refers to the ECB and the NCBs of all the EU Member States .
On the other hand , and by the effect of other provisions , Â« ESCB Â» also refers to the ECB and the central banks of only those EU Member States which have adopted the euro .
This second concept is different from the first one , since it embodies the exclusive competence for defining and conducting monetary policy , including the issue and the overall management of the euro , the management of the official foreign reserves of the Member States that have adopted the euro , and promoting the smooth operation of payment systems .
The actions necessary to carry out this competence require a high degree of harmonisation of procedures , instruments and infrastructure , and a single decision-making body with regulatory capacity .
A significant number of the issues that are of particular interest for EMU are discussed not only within international organisations but also in informal multinational groupings , many of which are standard-setters for financial markets ( e.g. G-10 , etc .) .
In order to clearly express that the scope of Article III-90 extends to those groups , the ECB would like to suggest that the word Â« fora Â» be used in addition to the word Â« conferences Â» in paragraphs 1 and 3 of Article III-90 of the draft Constitution .
The EU Treaty has created these two realities by introducing in the EC Treaty and in the Statute Articles that distinguish between which provisions apply to one composition or to the other .
This legislative technique does not serve the aim of clarity and comprehension of the EC Treaty .
In order to distinguish the second concept of Â« ESCB Â» , the Governing Council adopted and has been using since 1998 the term Â« Eurosystem Â» in its communications with the public .
With a view to simplify and make the Constitution more accessible for European citizens and
In order to enhance the precision of Article III-90 of the draft Constitution , the ECB would like to recommend the addition of the word Â« monetary Â» to Â« international financial institutions Â» , so as to clearly restrict this provision to Â« international monetary and financial institutions Â» .
Moreover , in order to address the inconsistency between paragraphs 1 and 3 of Article III-90 , the ECB would like to recommend either the insertion in paragraph 3 of the expression Â« after consultation of the European Central Bank Â» or the deletion of the expression Â« on a proposal from the Commission Â» since the Â« procedural provisions of ( paragraph ) 1 . .
apply Â» and the only procedural provisions of that paragraph are a proposal from the Commission and the consultation of the ECB . C 229/10
F. Other provisions that affect the institutional status of the ECB 18 .
Article I-59 of the draft Constitution contains a new set of rules for voluntary withdrawal from the Union , and in particular , requires an exit agreement Â« setting out the arrangements for the withdrawal Â» and organises the Union 's allocation of competences and procedures .
To the extent that such arrangements enter into the fields of competence of the ECB , the ECB understands that it will be fully associated with the Council of Ministers in the procedure .
The ECB acknowledges the choice made by the draft Constitution to make the Â« ordinary legislative procedure Â» ( currently the Â« co-decision procedure ') the basic rule for the adoption of legislation , fully involving the Parliament and requiring qualified majority voting in the Council .
The ECB notes that the draft Constitution moves to the legislative procedure the adoption of certain legislation that concerns the EMU institutional set-up , such as the transfer to the ECB of specific tasks concerning policies relating to prudential supervision of credit institutions ( Article III-77 ( 6 )) and the simplified amendment of the Statute ( Article III-79 ( 5 )) , whereas in other areas such as the appointment of the members of the Executive Board it retains the Â« common accord Â» .
Articles III-88 and III-89 of the draft Constitution refer to the Eurogroup , for which a new Protocol has been created and will be annexed to the Constitution .
The ECB welcomes the fact that the Constitution incorporates the Eurogroup , in line with the conclusions of the Luxembourg European Council of 12-13 December 1997 .
In view of the draft Constitution 's recognition of the Eurogroup , the ECB would like to state that it understands the wording of Article 1 of the Eurogroup Protocol as being without prejudice to the tasks and responsibilities of the ESCB , as described in the draft Constitution .
G. Exchange-rate convergence criterion 21 .
Article III-92 ( 1 )( c ) of the draft Constitution refers to the exchange-rate criterion as follows : Â« the observance of the normal fluctuation margins provided for by the exchange-rate mechanism for at least two years , without devaluing against the euro Â» .
This text reiterates the wording of Article 121 of the EC Treaty but deletes the reference to the European Monetary System ( EMS ) which no longer exists .
However , this deletion may imply that the expression Â« observance of the normal fluctuation margins
provided for by the exchange-rate mechanism Â» could henceforth only reasonably be understood as referring to the standard Â± 15 % fluctuation band of the new exchange-rate mechanism ( ERM II ) .
This interpretation would not be in line with the way in which the exchange-rate criterion has been applied in the past , where due account was taken of the fact that when Article 121 was drafted ( originally Article 109j ) the normal fluctuation margins of the exchange-rate mechanism ( ERM ) were Â± 2,25 %.
For reasons of legal clarity , and equal treatment among past , current and future members of the ERM II , the ECB would like to suggest the following amendment to Article III-92 ( 1 )( c ) : Â« the observance of the normal fluctuation margins provided for by participation in the exchange-rate mechanism for at least two years without severe tensions , in particular without devaluing against the euro .'
A reference to the need to avoid Â« severe tensions Â» is already included in the Protocol on the convergence criteria . It has served as a basis for applying --- in the ECB convergence reports and Commission assessments --- the exchange-rate criterion in accordance with its intended scope .
This opinion is drafted under the premise that the Protocol on the convergence criteria referred to in Article 121 of the EC Treaty will be annexed to the Constitution and without any changes to the substance .
H. Editorial suggestions 22 .
In paragraph 3 of Article III-91 the ECB would propose that the text be improved by replacing Â« Under Chapter IX Â» with Â« Under the conditions laid down in Chapter IX Â» .
In the second sentence of Article III-278 ( d ) of the draft Constitution the word Â« Council Â» should be replaced by Â« Governing Council Â» , in order to avoid confusion with the General Council of the ECB .
This opinion will be published in the Official Journal of the European Union and on the website of the ECB .

6 March 2008 - Annual Accounts of the European Central Bank for the year ending 31 December 2007
The Governing Council of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) today approved the audited Annual Accounts of the ECB for the year ending 31 December 2007 .
The ECB earned a surplus of Euros 286 million in 2007 , compared with a surplus of Euros 1,379 million earned in 2006 .
The reduction is due mainly to the appreciation of the euro against the US dollar and , to a lesser extent , the Japanese yen .
As in 2006 , based on the Governing Council 's assessment of the ECB 's risk exposures , an amount equivalent to the surplus was set aside in the provision against foreign exchange rate , interest rate and gold price risks , leaving a declared net profit of exactly nil .
Its size is reviewed annually .
Interest income in 2007 improved mainly as a result of the increase in the marginal rate for the Eurosystem 's main refinancing operations , which determines the remuneration that the ECB receives on its share of euro banknotes in the Eurosystem .
The ECB earned total net interest income of Euros 2,421 million from all sources , compared with Euros 1,972 million in 2006 .
Excluding the interest income of Euros 2,004 million earned on the share of banknotes in circulation , net interest income amounted to Euros 417 million , compared with Euros 653 million in 2006 .
The ECB paid remuneration of Euros 1,357 million to the national central banks ( NCBs ) on their claims in respect of the foreign reserve assets transferred by them to the ECB .
In 2007 , the appreciation of the euro vis-Ã -vis the US dollar and , to a lesser extent , the Japanese yen resulted in write-downs of some Euros 2.5 billion in the euro value of the ECB 's holdings of assets denominated in these currencies , which were expensed in the Profit and Loss Account .
The ECB 's administrative expenses on staff , rental of premises , professional fees , and other goods and services amounted to Euros 359 million ( Euros 332 million in 2006 ) .
Depreciation charges on fixed assets amounted to Euros 26 million .
The Annual Accounts will be published , together with a management report for the year ending 31 December 2007 , in the ECB 's Annual Report on 21 April 2008 .
Accounting policies of the ECB : Common accounting policies have been established by the Governing Council for the Eurosystem , including the ECB , in accordance with Article 26.4 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank ( Statute of the ESCB ) , and have been published in the Official Journal of the European Union .
[ 1 ] Although generally based on internationally accepted accounting practice , these policies were designed with special regard to the unique circumstances of the central banks of the Eurosystem . They pay particular attention to the issue of prudence given the large foreign exchange exposures of most of these central banks .
Remuneration of foreign reserve assets transferred to the ECB : On transferring foreign reserve assets to the ECB upon joining the Eurosystem , each NCB acquires a remunerated claim on the ECB equivalent to the amount it transfers .
In 2007 this remuneration resulted in an interest expense of Euros 1,357 million , compared with net interest income of Euros 1,355 million earned on the foreign reserve assets .
Distribution of the ECB 's income on euro banknotes in circulation : The Governing Council decided that , from 2006 , this income is due to the NCBs in the financial year in which it accrues , but is to be distributed on the second working day of the following year .
[ 2 ] It is distributed in full unless the ECB 's net profit for the year is less than its income earned on euro banknotes in circulation . The latter was the case in 2007 , due to the decision by the Governing Council to make transfers to the provision for foreign exchange rate , interest rate and gold price risks .
Based on the ECB 's estimated financial result for the year , the Governing Council decided in December 2007 to withhold distribution of the whole of this income .

13 March 2008 - Monthly Bulletin
On the basis of its regular economic and monetary analyses , the Governing Council of the ECB decided at its meeting on 6 March 2008 to leave the key ECB interest rates unchanged .
The information that has become available since the previous meeting of the Governing Council on 7 February has confirmed the existence of strong short-term upward pressure on inflation .
It has also confirmed the assessment that there are upside risks to price stability over the medium term , in a context of very vigorous money and credit growth .
Incoming macroeconomic data point to moderating but ongoing real GDP growth .
Yet the level of uncertainty resulting from the turmoil in financial markets remains high .
Against this background , the Governing Council emphasises that maintaining price stability in the medium term is its primary objective in accordance with its mandate .
Indeed , the firm anchoring of medium to longer-term inflation expectations is of the highest priority .
Considering first the economic analysis , the latest information on economic activity confirms the picture of moderating growth around the turn of the year .
According to Eurostat 's first estimate , the quarter-on-quarter growth rate of euro area real GDP in the fourth quarter of 2007 was 0.4% , following 0.8% in the previous quarter .
Surveys of business and consumer confidence , which have followed a downward trend since the summer of 2007 , overall remain consistent with ongoing growth .
Looking ahead , in 2008 both domestic and foreign demand are expected to support ongoing real GDP growth in the euro area , albeit at lower rates than during 2007 .
The fundamentals of the euro area economy remain sound and the euro area economy does not suffer from major imbalances .
While being dampened by the global slowdown , investment growth should provide ongoing support , as capacity utilisation is high and profitability has been sustained .
Despite the dampening effect of higher commodity prices , consumption growth should continue to contribute to economic expansion , in line with rising employment .
These factors are also reflected in the March 2008 ECB staff macroeconomic projections .
Annual real GDP growth is projected to lie in the range of 1.3% to 2.1% in 2008 , and to be between 1.3% and 2.3% in 2009 .
In comparison with the December 2007 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections , the ranges projected for real GDP growth in 2008 and 2009 have been revised downwards , reflecting weaker global demand , stronger pressure from commodity prices and less favourable financing conditions than were foreseen in December .
In the view of the Governing Council , uncertainty about the prospects for economic growth remains unusually high .
Downside risks to the outlook for economic activity continue to exist . They relate mainly to a potentially broader than currently expected impact of financial market developments .
Further downside risks stem from the scope for additional commodity price rises , protectionist pressures and the possibility of disorderly developments owing to global imbalances .
With regard to price developments , according to Eurostat 's flash estimate , the annual HICP inflation rate was 3.2% in February 2008 , unchanged from January .
This confirms the strong upward pressure on inflation in the short term , stemming mainly from the increases in energy and food prices in recent months .
Looking ahead , the Governing Council expects a more protracted period of relatively high rates of inflation than it did a few months ago. The annual HICP inflation rate will most likely remain significantly above 2 % in the coming months and moderate only gradually later in the year .
The March 2008 ECB staff macroeconomic projections foresee annual HICP inflation of between 2.6% and 3.2% in 2008 , and between 1.5% and 2.7% in 2009 .
Compared with the December 2007 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections , the projected ranges for HICP inflation have shifted upwards , mainly reflecting significant additional increases in food and energy prices .
It is important to recall that these staff projections are based on a number of assumptions which are of a purely technical nature and unrelated to policy intentions .
In particular , the technical assumptions for short-term interest rates are taken from market expectations as at mid-February .
Moreover , it should be noted that the projections are based on the assumptions that the recent dynamism in commodity prices will diminish over the projection horizon , in line with futures prices , and that pressure from labour costs and profit margins will be limited .
In the view of the Governing Council , the risks to the outlook for inflation over the medium term are on the upside .
These risks include further rises in oil and agricultural prices , continuing the strong upward trend observed in recent months . Furthermore , they include the possibility that stronger than currently expected wage growth may emerge , taking into account high capacity utilisation and tight labour market conditions .
Moreover , the pricing power of firms , notably in market segments with low competition , could be stronger than expected .
Increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those foreseen thus far also pose upside risks to the inflation outlook .
At this juncture , it is imperative that all parties concerned meet their responsibilities and that second-round effects on price-setting , on the one hand , and on wages , on the other hand , stemming from current inflation rates be avoided .
Annual M3 growth remained very vigorous at 11.5% in January , supported by the continued strong growth of MFI loans to the private sector .
A number of temporary factors suggest that M3 growth currently overstates the pace of the underlying monetary expansion .
The relatively flat yield curve in particular has made holding monetary assets more attractive .
The growth of household borrowing has moderated over recent months , reflecting the impact of higher key ECB interest rates since December 2005 and cooling housing markets in several parts of the euro area . However , the growth of loans to non-financial corporations has remained very robust .
Bank borrowing by euro area non-financial corporations grew at an annual rate of 14.6% in the year to January 2008 .
Overall , bank loans to the domestic private sector have grown at around 11 % on an annual basis for the past two years .
For the time being , there is little evidence that the financial market turbulence since early August 2007 strongly influenced the overall dynamics of broad money and credit aggregates up to January 2008 .
In addition , according to the available data , the turmoil has not led to substantial portfolio shifts into monetary assets , as were observed between 2001 and 2003 .
To sum up , a cross-check of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis fully confirms the assessment that there are upside risks to price stability over the medium term , in a context of very vigorous money and credit growth .
The Governing Council emphasises that the firm anchoring of medium to longer-term inflation expectations is of the highest priority .
Regarding fiscal policies , the Governing Council welcomes the fact that the Berlin Eurogroup agreement of April 2007 , including the consolidation targets , was confirmed in the ECOFIN Council 's opinions on the latest stability programme updates .
There is no justification for delaying structural fiscal consolidation in countries with remaining fiscal imbalances .
On the contrary , the challenges ahead call for particularly prudent and stability-oriented fiscal policies to support private sector confidence .
Achieving and maintaining sound fiscal positions will also allow the free operation of automatic stabilisers and contribute to the smooth functioning of Economic and Monetary Union .
Structural reforms would not only be beneficial for employment and potential growth , but would also help to reduce inflationary pressures .
Enhancing competition , especially in services and network industries , is essential at this juncture to support price stability and enhance productivity growth .
Similarly , administered prices , indirect taxes , minimum wage legislation and public sector wage-setting should not add to inflationary pressures in the economy .

Demolition of the western annexe building Â© Robert Metsch
Hand removal of the brickwork and demolition of the western annexe building Â© Robert Metsch
Dismantling -- brick by brick
Between the spring and autumn of 2008 , preliminary construction work was carried out on the site of the former Grossmarkthalle and the new premises of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) to prepare the ground for the main construction works .
The disused railway platform and the two four-storey annexe buildings were demolished .
Parts of the annexe buildings were carefully pulled down by hand so that the bricks can be used to renovate the facade of the former Grossmarkthalle .
The reason for this is that the colour of new bricks would not match that of the old ones owing to different manufacturing techniques and materials .
Preliminary site work
Before it could hand over the site to the ECB , the City of Frankfurt am Main was responsible for clearing the site and preparing it for the handover .
These works were carried out between the spring and autumn of 2004 and involved the demolition of buildings that were not worth preserving : to the south of the Grossmarkthalle these were the Â« blaue Halle Â» , the Â« Importhalle Â» , which served primarily as a depot for incoming tropical fruits , and the Â« Ami-Halle Â» ( hall used by US-Americans ) ;
to the north of the Grossmarkthalle , between the market hall and the Sonnemannstrasse , the smaller Â« HallenhÃ¼tten Â» were also torn down .
Recycling
The rubble resulting from these demolition works , for example wood , bricks , glass and roofing materials , was carefully sorted , preserved and then either recycled or disposed of .

18 November 2004 - The Governing Council of the ECB decides not to introduce very low denomination euro banknotes
After careful consideration , the Governing Council of the ECB has decided not to revise the earlier decision on the denominations of the euro banknotes ( see the ECB 's press release of 12 September 1998 ) and consequently not to issue Euros 1 or Euros 2 banknotes .
The Governing Council has assessed all arguments put forward in the debate and concluded that , on balance , the negative aspects of introducing very low denomination banknotes outweigh the positive aspects .
In particular , the insufficient demand for very low denomination banknotes by the majority of euro area citizens , the increased inefficiency the introduction would imply for most of the affected third parties , for instance the retail sector and the vending machine industry , and the high costs of printing and processing support the Governing Council 's decision on this issue .

OPINION OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK of 2 December 2008 at the request of the Spanish State Secretary for Economic Affairs on a draft royal decree on the arrangements for paying the Banco de EspaÃ±a 's profits to the Treasury ( CON / 2008/82 )
Introduction and legal basis On 5 November 2008 the European Central Bank ( ECB ) received a request from the Spanish State Secretary for Economic Affairs for an opinion on a draft Royal decree on the arrangements for paying the Banco de EspaÃ±a 's profits to the Treasury ( hereinafter the Â« draft decree ') .
The ECB 's competence to deliver an opinion is based on Article 105 ( 4 ) of the Treaty establishing the European Community and the third indent of Article 2 ( 1 ) of Council Decision 98/415 / EC of 29 June 1998 on the consultation of the European Central Bank by national authorities regarding draft legislative provisions1 , as the draft decree relates to the Banco de EspaÃ±a .
Purpose of the draft decree
The draft degree is intended to improve the operation and legal certainty of the current payment scheme by deferring the first payment of the Banco de EspaÃ±a 's profits to December and giving the scheme unlimited validity now that the ECB 's transitional period regarding the provisions on monetary income distribution2 is over .
Spain has consulted the ECB on the arrangements for paying the Banco de EspaÃ±a 's profits to the Treasury on three previous occasions3 .
The technical modifications proposed in the draft decree do not affect the substance of the current scheme . The payment schedule for profits accrued to the Banco de EspaÃ±a , recorded in its accounts and paid to the Treasury is proposed as follows :
Decision ECB / 2001/16 of 6 December 2001 on the allocation of monetary income of the national central banks of participating Member Status from the financial year 2002 ( OJ L 337 , 20.12.2001 , p. 55 ) .
ECB Opinions CON / 2005/30 of 11 August 2005 , CON / 2002/14 of 25 April 2002 and CON / 99/16 of 28 October 1999 .
Available on the ECB 's website at www.ecb.europa.eu .
-- on the first working day of December of each year , 70 % of the profits accrued and recorded until 30 September of the same financial year , while the foreseen development of the results until yearend is also taken into consideration ;
-- on the first working day in March in the next year , 90 % of the profits accrued and recorded until 31 December of the preceding financial year , less the instalment paid in December ;
-- the remaining profits following approval by the Council of Ministers of the Banco de EspaÃ±a 's annual accounts for the financial year .
The Council of Ministers , on a proposal from the Banco de EspaÃ±a , may also authorise the exclusion of certain profits from the interim distribution rules .
Specific observations Deferral to December of the first payment of profits to the Treasury The ECB welcomes the proposed deferral , from November to December , of the first payment of the Banco de EspaÃ±a 's profits to the Treasury . It will bring the estimation of year-end results closer to the end of the year .
Financial independence The distribution of provisional profits before the end of the year entails the need to carefully consider the Banco de EspaÃ±a 's role in the decision-making process for profit distribution .
The concept of financial independence should be assessed from the perspective of whether any third party is able to exercise either direct or indirect influence not only over the tasks of a national central bank ( NCB ) but also over its ability , understood both operationally in terms of manpower4 , and financially in terms of appropriate financial resources , to fulfil its mandate .
The NCBs must also , at all times , have sufficient financial means to carry out their other functions , i.e. to perform their national tasks , to meet their international obligations and properly cover their administrative and operational expenses .
It should be noted that Articles 28.1 and 30.4 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank ( hereinafter the Â« ESCB Statute ) provide for further calls on the NCBs to make further contributions to the capital of the ECB and to make further transfers of foreign reserves .
The principle of financial independence requires that compliance with these provisions leaves an NCB 's ability to perform its functions unimpaired .
With regard to profit allocation , an NCB 's statutes may prescribe how profits are to be allocated .
In the absence of such provisions , the decision on allocation of profits should be taken by the NCB 's decision-making bodies on professional grounds , and should not be subject to the discretion of third parties unless there is an express safeguard clause stating that this is without prejudice to the financial means necessary for carrying out the NCB 's tasks related to the European System of Central Banks ( ESCB ) . In this regard , the ECB notes that under Article 1 of the draft decree , and also under Royal Decree 1198/2005 , the Banco de EspaÃ±a adopts the prepayment
See ECB Opinion CON / 2008/9 of 21 February 2008 at the request of the German Ministry of Finance on a draft law amending the Law on the Deutsche Bundesbank ; also ECB Opinion CON / 2008/10 of 21 February 2008 at the request of the Italian Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance on some provisions of the Law on the State annual and pluriannual budget ( 2008 Budget law ) .
agreement and the estimation of year-end results and proposes which part of its profits should be excluded from payment to the Treasury .
The ECB understands that these rules grant the Banco de EspaÃ±a the right to create provisions , thereby enabling it to build up financial reserves that should help to guarantee the availability of appropriate independent financial means to meet its obligations .
Moreover , the ECB understands that the application of such rules , and the level of the provision , has ensured such availability of independent financial means , and the ECB considers it important that it continues to do so .
Furthermore , regarding Article 1 ( 2 ) of the draft decree and the Banco de EspaÃ±a 's proposal to exclude some profits from provisional payment , the ECB considers that the authorisation of such exclusion by the Council of Ministers should be limited and should avoid any exercise of discretion in this context .
3.3 Monetary financing Given the primacy of Community law , it is important to note that the application of the ESCB Statute may not be conditional on the provisions of national law .
In particular , the draft decree must comply with the monetary financing prohibition laid down in Article 101 ( 1 ) of the Treaty and Council Regulation ( EC ) No 3603/93 of 13 December 1993 specifying definitions for the application of the prohibitions referred to in Articles 104 and 104b ( 1 ) of the Treaty5 .
This Regulation prohibits overdraft facilities or any other type of credit facility with the ECB or the NCBs of Member States in favour of Community institutions or bodies , central governments , regional , local or other public authorities , other bodies governed by public law , or public undertakings of Member States , and the purchase directly from these public sector entities by the ECB or NCBs of debt instruments .
In order to comply with the monetary financing prohibition , it is of crucial importance that the distribution of profits by instalments does not imply advances on future or provisional profits but is rather the result only of profits that are fully realised , accounted for and audited , which in turn requires due calculation of profits and losses .
In this context , it appears necessary to have formal approval of the profit and loss account for the considered period before the distribution of profits .
Although a ceiling of 70 % of profits for the first payment provides some safeguard , it could theoretically not be sufficient if , for instance , heavy losses at year-end exceeded 30 % of the profits realised in the first nine months of the financial year6 .
In this regard , the risk of insufficient coverage of losses at year-end is reduced by deferring the first payment from November to December .
In this context , the ECB understands that the Governing Council of the Banco de EspaÃ±a will assess the amount to be deducted from the first payment on the basis of information known in December related to the profits for the greater part of the year ( 11 months out of 12 ) .
The Governing Council of the Banco de EspaÃ±a should apply this arrangement prudently to ensure that
OJ L 332 , 31.12.1998 , p. 1 . In paragraph 6 ( ii ) of CON / 99/16 the ECB stated that the draft Â« would better satisfy this concern by providing for a formal approval by the Governing Council of Banco de EspaÃ±a of the profits and loss account which serves as a basis for the calculation of the advance pay outs , and the pay out be conditioned to an assessment by that body that expected economic developments for the final quarter of the year would not give rise to such a risk .'
