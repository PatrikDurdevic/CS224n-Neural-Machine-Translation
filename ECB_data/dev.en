INTRODUCTION This document presents the operational framework chosen by the Eurosystem * for the single monetary policy in the euro area .
This document is divided into seven chapters . Chapter 1 gives an overview of the operational framework for the monetary policy of the Eurosystem .
The appendices contain examples of monetary policy operations , a glossary , criteria for the selection of counterparties for Eurosystem foreign exchange intervention operations , a presentation of the reporting framework for the money and banking statistics of the European Central Bank , a list of the Eurosystem websites , a description of the procedures and sanctions to be applied in the event of non-compliance with counterparty obligations and additional legal requirements for the creation of valid security over credit claims when these are used as collateral with the Eurosystem .
* The Governing Council of the European Central Bank has agreed to use the term « Eurosystem » to denote those components of the European System of Central Banks that carry out its basic tasks , i.e. the European Central Bank and the national central banks of those Member States which have adopted the single currency in accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Community .

CHAPTER 1 OVERVIEW OF THE MONETARY POLICY FRAMEWORK 1.1 THE EUROPEAN SYSTEM OF CENTRAL BANKS The European System of Central Banks ( ESCB ) consists of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) and the national central banks of the European Union ( EU ) Member States .
1 The activities of the ESCB are carried out in accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Community ( Treaty ) and the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank ( Statute of the ESCB ) .
To the extent deemed possible and appropriate and with a view to ensuring operational efficiency , the ECB has recourse to the national central banks 2 for carrying out the operations which form part of the tasks of the Eurosystem .
The national central banks may , if necessary for the implementation of monetary policy , share amongst the Eurosystem members individual information , such as operational data , related to counterparties participating in Eurosystem operations .
3 The Eurosystem 's monetary policy operations are executed under uniform terms and conditions in all Member States .
4 1.3 EUROSYSTEM MONETARY POLICY INSTRUMENTS In order to achieve its objectives , the Eurosystem has at its disposal a set of monetary policy instruments ;
1.3.1 OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS Open market operations play an important role in the monetary policy of the Eurosystem for the purposes of steering interest rates , managing the liquidity situation in the market and signalling the stance of monetary policy .
They can be executed on the basis of standard tenders , quick
1.2 OBJECTIVES OF THE EUROSYSTEM 1 The primary objective of the Eurosystem is to maintain price stability , as defined in Article 105 of the Treaty .
It should be noted that the national central banks of those Member States which have not adopted the single currency in accordance with the Treaty establishing the European Community ( Treaty ) retain their powers in the field of monetary policy according to national law and are thus not involved in the conduct of the single monetary policy .
Throughout this document , the term « national central banks » refers to the national central banks of the Member States which have adopted the single currency in accordance with the Treaty .
Such information is subject to the requirement for professional secrecy in accordance with Article 38 of the Statute of the ESCB .
Throughout this document , the term « Member State » refers to a Member State which has adopted the single currency in accordance with the Treaty .
7 tenders or bilateral procedures .
5 With regard to their aims , regularity and procedures , the Eurosystem 's open market operations can be divided into the following four categories ( see also Table 1 ) : -* The main refinancing operations are regular liquidity-providing reverse transactions with a weekly frequency and a maturity of normally one week . These operations are executed by the national central banks on the basis of standard tenders .
The main refinancing operations play a pivotal role in pursuing the objectives of the Eurosystem 's open market operations .
The longer-term refinancing operations are liquidity-providing reverse transactions with a monthly frequency and a maturity of normally three months .
Fine-tuning operations are executed on an ad hoc basis with the aim of managing the liquidity situation in the market and steering interest rates , in particular in order to smooth the effects on interest rates caused by unexpected liquidity fluctuations in the market .
Fine-tuning operations may be conducted on the last day of a reserve maintenance period to counter liquidity imbalances which may have accumulated since the allotment of the last main refinancing operation .
-* In addition , the Eurosystem may carry out structural operations through the issuance of debt certificates , reverse transactions and outright transactions .
These operations are executed whenever the ECB wishes to adjust the structural position of the Eurosystem vis - à-vis the financial sector ( on a regular or non-regular basis ) .
-* 1.3.2 STANDING FACILITIES Standing facilities are aimed at providing and absorbing overnight liquidity , signal the general stance of monetary policy and bound overnight market interest rates .
Two standing facilities are available to eligible counterparties on their own initiative , subject to their fulfilment of certain operational access conditions ( see also Table 1 ) : -* Counterparties can use the marginal lending facility to obtain overnight liquidity from the national central banks against eligible assets .
Under normal circumstances , there are no credit limits or other restrictions on counterparties » access to the facility , apart The different procedures for the execution of Eurosystem open market operations , i.e. standard tenders , quick tenders and bilateral procedures , are specified in Chapter 5 .
Quick tenders are normally executed within a time frame of 90 minutes .

from the requirement to present sufficient underlying assets .
-* Counterparties can use the deposit facility to make overnight deposits with the national central banks .
to pursue the aim of stabilising interest rates , the Eurosystem 's minimum reserve system enables institutions to make use of averaging provisions .
1.4 COUNTERPARTIES The Eurosystem 's monetary policy framework is formulated with a view to ensuring the participation of a broad range of counterparties .
Institutions subject to minimum reserve requirements according to Article 19.1 of the Statute of the ESCB may access the standing facilities and participate in open market operations based on standard tenders as well as outright transactions .
The Eurosystem may select a limited number of counterparties to participate in fine-tuning operations .
For foreign exchange swaps conducted for monetary policy purposes , active players in the foreign exchange market are used . The set of counterparties for these operations is limited to those institutions ECB The implementation of monetary policy in the euro area November 2008
The standing facilities are administered in a decentralised manner by the national central banks . 1.3.3 MINIMUM RESERVES The Eurosystem 's minimum reserve system applies to credit institutions in the euro area and primarily pursues the aims of stabilising money market interest rates and creating ( or enlarging ) a structural liquidity shortage .
The reserve requirement of each institution is determined in relation to elements of its balance sheet . In order
selected for Eurosystem foreign exchange intervention operations which are located in the euro area .
1.5 UNDERLYING ASSETS Pursuant to Article 18.1 of the Statute of the ESCB , all Eurosystem credit operations ( i.e. liquidity-providing monetary policy operations and intraday credit ) have to be based on adequate collateral .
The Eurosystem has developed a single framework for eligible collateral common to all Eurosystem credit operations ( also referred to as the « Single List ") .
On 1 January 2007 , this single framework replaced the two-tier system that had been in place since the start of Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union .
The single framework covers marketable and non-marketable assets that fulfil uniform euro area-wide eligibility criteria specified by the Eurosystem .
1.6 MODIFICATIONS TO THE MONETARY POLICY FRAMEWORK The Governing Council of the ECB may , at any time , change the instruments , conditions , criteria and procedures for the execution of Eurosystem monetary policy operations .
ECB The implementation of monetary policy in the euro area November 2008 CHAPTER 2 ELIGIBLE COUNTERPARTIES 2.1 GENERAL ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Counterparties for Eurosystem monetary policy operations must fulfil certain eligibility criteria .
1 These criteria are defined with a view to giving a broad range of institutions access to Eurosystem monetary policy operations , enhancing equal treatment of institutions across the euro area and ensuring that counterparties fulfil certain operational and prudential requirements : -* Only institutions subject to the Eurosystem 's minimum reserve system according to Article 19.1 of the Statute of the ESCB are eligible to be counterparties .
Counterparties must be financially sound .
They should be subject to at least one form of harmonised EU / EEA supervision by national authorities .
2 However , financially sound institutions subject to non-harmonised national supervision of a comparable standard can also be accepted as counterparties , e.g. branches established in the euro area of institutions that have their head office outside the European Economic Area ( EEA ) .
Counterparties must fulfil any operational criteria specified in the relevant contractual or regulatory arrangements applied by the respective national central bank ( or the ECB ) , so as to ensure the efficient conduct of Eurosystem monetary policy operations .
An institution may access the Eurosystem 's standing facilities and open market operations based on standard tenders only through the national central bank of the Member State in which it is established .
If an institution has establishments ( its head office or branches ) in more than one Member State , each establishment has access to these operations through the national central bank of the Member State in which it is located , notwithstanding the fact that the bids of an institution may only be submitted by one establishment ( either the head office or a designated branch ) in each Member State . CHAPTER 2 Eligible counterparties
2.2 SELECTION OF COUNTERPARTIES FOR QUICK TENDERS AND BILATERAL OPERATIONS For outright transactions , no restrictions are placed a priori on the range of counterparties .
For foreign exchange swaps executed for monetary policy purposes , counterparties must be able to conduct large-volume foreign exchange operations efficiently under all market conditions . The range of counterparties to foreign exchange swaps corresponds to the counterparties located in the euro area which are selected for Eurosystem foreign exchange intervention operations .
For other operations based on quick tenders and bilateral procedures ( fine-tuning reverse transactions and the collection of fixed-term deposits ) , each national central bank selects a set of counterparties from among the institutions established in its Member State which fulfil the general counterparty eligibility criteria . In this respect , activity in the money market is the prime selection criterion .
Other 1 2 For outright transactions , no restrictions are placed a priori on the range of counterparties . Harmonised supervision of credit institutions is based on Directive 2006/48 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2006 relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions ( recast ) , Official Journal of the European Union ( OJ ) L 177 , 30.6.2006 , p. 1 .
These general eligibility criteria are uniform throughout the euro area . Institutions fulfilling the general eligibility criteria may : -* access the Eurosystem 's standing facilities ;
and participate in Eurosystem open market operations that are based on standard tenders . -*
criteria which might be taken into account are , for example , the efficiency of the trading desk and the bidding potential . In quick tenders and bilateral operations , the national central banks deal with the counterparties which are included in their respective set of fine-tuning counterparties .
Quick tenders and bilateral operations may also be executed with a broader range of counterparties . If , for operational reasons , a national central bank cannot deal in each operation with all of its fine-tuning counterparties , the selection of counterparties in this Member State will be based on a rotation scheme in order to ensure equitable access .
The Governing Council of the ECB can decide whether , under exceptional circumstances , fine-tuning bilateral operations may be carried out by the ECB itself . If the ECB were to carry out bilateral operations , the selection of counterparties would in such cases be made by the ECB according to a rotation scheme among those counterparties in the euro area which are eligible for quick tenders and bilateral operations in order to ensure equitable access .
The relevant sanctions and the procedural rules for their application are specified in the above-mentioned Regulations . In addition , in the case of serious infringements of the minimum reserve requirements , the Eurosystem may suspend counterparties » participation in open market operations .
In accordance with the provisions of the contractual or regulatory arrangements applied by the respective national central bank ( or by the ECB ) , the Eurosystem can and will impose financial penalties on counterparties , or suspend counterparties » participation in open market operations , if counterparties fail to comply with their obligations under the contractual or regulatory arrangements applied by the national central banks ( or by the ECB ) as set out below . This relates to cases of infringement of tender rules ( if a counterparty is unable to transfer a sufficient amount of underlying assets to settle the amount of liquidity it has been allotted in a liquidity-providing operation , or if it is unable to deliver a sufficient amount of cash to settle the amount it has been allotted in a liquidity-absorbing operation ) , and of bilateral transaction rules ( if a counterparty is unable to deliver a sufficient amount of eligible underlying assets , or if it is unable to deliver a sufficient amount of cash to settle the amount agreed in bilateral transactions ) .
This also applies to cases of non-compliance by a counterparty with the rules for the use of underlying assets ( if a counterparty is using assets which are or have become ineligible , or which may not be used by the counterparty , e.g. owing to close links between , or the identity of , issuer / guarantor and counterparty ) , and to non-compliance with the rules for end-of-day procedures and access conditions for the marginal lending facility ( if a counterparty which has a negative balance on the settlement account 3 4 5 6 OJ L 318 , 27.11.1998 , p. 4 .
OJ L 264 , 12.10.1999 , p. 21 .
OJ L 250 , 2.10.2003 , p. 10 .
2.3 Sanctions in the event of non-compliance with counterparty obligations The ECB shall impose sanctions , in accordance with Council Regulation ( EC ) No 2532/98 of 23 November 1998 concerning the powers of the European Central Bank to impose sanctions , 3 European Central Bank Regulation ( EC ) No 2157/1999 of 23 September 1999 on the powers of the European Central Bank to impose sanctions ( ECB / 1999/4 ) , 4 Council Regulation ( EC ) No 2531/98 of 23 November 1998 concerning the application of minimum reserves by the European Central Bank , 5 as amended , and Regulation ( EC ) No 1745/2003 of the European Central Bank of 12 September 2003 on the application of minimum reserves ( ECB / 2003/9 ) , 6 on institutions which do not comply with obligations arising from ECB Regulations and 12
Financial penalties imposed by national central banks in the event of non-compliance in relation to a breach of the rules concerning tender operations , bilateral transactions , underlying assets , end-of-day procedures or the access conditions to the marginal lending facility are calculated at a pre-specified penalty rate ( as set out in Appendix 6 ) . Eligible counterparties
2.4 SUSPENSION OR EXCLUSION ON GROUNDS OF PRUDENCE OR EVENTS OF DEFAULT In accordance with the provisions in the contractual or regulatory arrangements applied by the respective national central bank ( or by the ECB ) , the Eurosystem may suspend or exclude counterparties » access to monetary policy instruments on the grounds of prudence .
In addition , a suspension or exclusion of counterparties may be warranted in some of the cases which fall within the notion of the « default » of a counterparty as defined in the contractual or regulatory arrangements applied by the national central banks .

CHAPTER 3 OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS Open market operations play an important role in the Eurosystem 's monetary policy .
Structural operations may also be conducted by means of outright transactions i.e. purchases and sales .
In addition , the Eurosystem has two other instruments available for the conduct of fine-tuning operations : foreign exchange swaps and the collection of fixed-term deposits .
retransfer of the asset to the debtor at a future point in time ) or as collateralised loans ( i.e. an enforceable security interest is provided over the assets but , assuming fulfilment of the debt obligation , the ownership of the asset is retained by the debtor ) .
INTEREST TERMS The difference between the purchase price and the repurchase price in a repurchase agreement corresponds to the interest due on the amount of money borrowed or lent over the maturity of the operation , i.e. the repurchase price includes the respective interest to be paid .
3.1.2 MAIN REFINANCING OPERATIONS The main refinancing operations are the most important open market operations conducted by the Eurosystem , playing a pivotal role in pursuing the aims of steering interest rates , managing the liquidity situation in the market and signalling the stance of monetary policy .
The operational features of the main refinancing operations can be summarised as follows : -* they are operations ;
liquidity-providing reverse
3.1 REVERSE TRANSACTIONS 3.1.1 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS TYPE OF INSTRUMENT Reverse transactions refer to operations where the Eurosystem buys or sells eligible assets under repurchase agreements or conducts credit operations against eligible assets as collateral .
Reverse transactions are used for main refinancing operations and longerterm refinancing operations .
LEGAL NATURE The national central banks may execute reverse transactions either in the form of repurchase agreements ( i.e. the ownership of the asset is transferred to the creditor , while the parties agree to reverse the transaction through a
ECB The implementation of monetary policy in the euro area November 2008 CHAPTER 3 -* -* -* they are executed regularly each week ;
1 they normally have a maturity of one week ;
2 -* they are executed in a decentralised manner by the national central banks ;
-* -* they are executed through standard tenders ( as specified in Section 5.1 ) ;
all counterparties fulfilling the general eligibility criteria ( as specified in Section 2.1 ) may submit bids for the main refinancing operations ; and marketable and non-marketable assets ( as specified in Chapter 6 ) are eligible as underlying assets for the main refinancing operations .
all counterparties fulfilling the general eligibility criteria ( as specified in Section 2.1 ) may submit bids for the longer-term refinancing operations ; and marketable and non-marketable assets ( as specified in Chapter 6 ) are eligible as underlying assets for the longer-term refinancing operations .
3.1.4 FINE-TUNING REVERSE OPERATIONS The Eurosystem can execute fine-tuning operations in the form of reverse open market transactions .
Fine-tuning operations aim to manage the liquidity situation in the market and to steer interest rates , in particular in order to smooth the effects on interest rates caused by unexpected liquidity fluctuations in the market .
Fine-tuning operations may be conducted on the last day of a reserve maintenance period to counter liquidity imbalances which may have accumulated since the allotment of the last main refinancing operation .
The potential need for rapid action in the case of unexpected market developments makes it desirable to retain a high degree of flexibility in the choice of procedures and operational features in the conduct of these operations .
The operational features of the fine-tuning reverse operations can be summarised as follows : -* they can take the form of liquidity-providing or liquidity-absorbing operations ;
3.1.3 LONGER-TERM REFINANCING OPERATIONS The Eurosystem also executes regular refinancing operations , normally with a three-month maturity , which are aimed at providing additional longer-term refinancing to the financial sector .
In these operations , the Eurosystem does not , as a rule , intend to send signals to the market and therefore normally acts as a rate taker .
Accordingly , longer-term refinancing operations are usually executed in the form of variable rate tenders and , from time to time , the ECB indicates the operation volume to be allotted in forthcoming tenders .
Under exceptional circumstances , the Eurosystem may also execute longer-term refinancing operations through fixed rate tenders . The operational features of the longer-term refinancing operations can be summarised as follows : -* -* -* they are liquidity-providing reverse operations ;
2 2 The main and the longer-term refinancing operations are executed in accordance with the Eurosystem 's pre-announced tender operations calendar ( see also Section 5.1.2 ) , which can be found on the ECB 's website ( www.ecb.europa.eu ) , as well as on the Eurosystem websites ( see Appendix 5 ) .
The maturity of the main and the longer-term refinancing operations may occasionally vary depending on , inter alia , bank holidays in Member States .

-* they are executed through standard tenders ( as specified in Section 5.1 ) ;
they are executed in a decentralised manner by the national central banks ; all counterparties fulfilling the general eligibility criteria ( as specified in Section 2.1 ) may submit bids for structural reverse operations ;
and marketable and non-marketable assets ( as specified in Chapter 6 ) are eligible as underlying assets for structural reverse operations .
-* liquidity-providing fine-tuning reverse transactions are normally executed through quick tenders , although the possibility of using bilateral procedures is not excluded ( see Chapter 5 ) ;
liquidity-absorbing fine-tuning reverse transactions are executed , as a rule , through bilateral procedures ( as specified in Section 5.2 ) ;
these operations are normally executed in a decentralised manner by the national central banks ( the Governing Council of the ECB can decide whether , under exceptional circumstances , bilateral fine-tuning reverse operations may be executed by the ECB ) ;
the Eurosystem may select , according to the criteria specified in Section 2.2 , a limited number of counterparties to participate in fine-tuning reverse operations ; and marketable and non-marketable assets ( as specified in Chapter 6 ) are eligible as underlying assets for fine-tuning reverse operations .
3.2 OUTRIGHT TRANSACTIONS TYPE OF INSTRUMENT Outright open market transactions refer to operations where the Eurosystem buys or sells eligible assets outright on the market .
Such operations are executed only for structural purposes .
LEGAL NATURE An outright transaction implies a full transfer of ownership from the seller to the buyer with no connected reverse transfer of ownership .
PRICE TERMS In the calculation of prices , the Eurosystem acts in accordance with the most widely accepted market convention for the debt instruments used in the transaction .
OTHER OPERATIONAL FEATURES The operational features of Eurosystem outright transactions can be summarised as follows : -* they can take the form of liquidity-providing ( outright purchase ) or liquidity-absorbing ( outright sale ) operations ; their frequency is not standardised ;
3.1.5 STRUCTURAL REVERSE OPERATIONS The Eurosystem may execute structural operations in the form of reverse open market transactions aimed at adjusting the structural position of the Eurosystem vis-à-vis the financial sector . The operational features of these operations can be summarised as follows : -* -* -* they are liquidity-providing operations ;
ECB The implementation of monetary policy in the euro area November 2008 CHAPTER 3 -* they are executed through bilateral procedures ( as specified in Section 5.2 ) ;
they are normally executed in a decentralised manner by the national central banks ;
no restrictions are placed a priori on the range of counterparties to outright transactions ; and only marketable assets ( as specified in Chapter 6 ) are used as underlying assets in outright transactions .
and are redeemed at maturity at the nominal amount .
The difference between the issue amount and the redemption amount equals the interest accrued on the issue amount , at the agreed interest rate , over the maturity of the certificate .
The interest rate applied is a simple interest rate based on the day-count convention « actual / 360 » .
The calculation of the issue amount is shown in Box 1 . OTHER OPERATIONAL FEATURES The operational features of the issuance of ECB debt certificates can be summarised as follows : -* the certificates are issued in order to absorb liquidity from the market ;
the certificates can be issued on a regular or non-regular basis ;
the certificates have a maturity of less than 12 months ; the certificates are issued through standard tenders ( as specified in Section 5.1 ) ;
the certificates are tendered and settled in a decentralised manner by the national central banks ; and all counterparties fulfilling the general eligibility criteria ( as specified in Section 2.1 ) may submit bids for the subscription of ECB debt certificates .
3.3 ISSUANCE OF ECB DEBT CERTIFICATES TYPE OF INSTRUMENT The ECB may issue debt certificates with the aim of adjusting the structural position of the Eurosystem vis-à-vis the financial sector so as to create ( or enlarge ) a liquidity shortage in the market . LEGAL NATURE The certificates constitute a debt obligation of the ECB vis-à-vis the holder of the certificate .
INTEREST TERMS The certificates are issued at a discount , i.e. they are issued at below the nominal amount Box 1
ISSUANCE OF ECB DEBT CERTIFICATES The issue amount is : where : N rI D PT = = = = nominal amount of the debt certificate interest rate ( in %) maturity of the debt certificate ( in days ) issue amount of the debt certificate ECB The implementation of monetary policy in the euro area November 2008 PT = N ×
3.4 FOREIGN EXCHANGE SWAPS TYPE OF INSTRUMENT Foreign exchange swaps executed for monetary policy purposes consist of simultaneous spot and forward transactions in euro against a foreign currency .
They are used for fine-tuning purposes , mainly with the aim of managing the liquidity situation in the market and steering interest rates . LEGAL NATURE Foreign exchange swaps executed for monetary policy purposes refer to operations where the Eurosystem buys ( or sells ) euro spot against a foreign currency and , at the same time , sells ( or buys ) it back in a forward transaction on a specified repurchase date .
Further provisions
for foreign exchange swaps are specified in the contractual arrangement applied by the respective national central bank ( or the ECB ) .
CURRENCY AND EXCHANGE RATE TERMS As a rule , the Eurosystem operates only in widely traded currencies and in accordance with standard market practice .
FOREIGN EXCHANGE SWAPS S = spot ( on the transaction date of the foreign exchange swap ) of the exchange rate between the euro ( EUR ) and a foreign currency ABC S = x × ABC 1 × EUR
FM = forward exchange rate between the euro and a foreign currency ABC on the repurchase date of the swap ( M ) FM = y × ABC 1 × EUR
∆M = forward points between the euro and ABC on the repurchase date of the swap ( M ) ∆M = FM -- S
N (. ) = spot amount of currency ;
) M is the forward amount of currency : N ( ABC ) S N ( ABC ) M FM N ( ABC ) = N ( EUR ) × S
or N ( EUR ) =
they are normally executed in a decentralised manner by the national central banks ( the Governing Council of the ECB can decide whether , under exceptional circumstances , bilateral foreign exchange swaps may be executed by the ECB ) ; and the Eurosystem may select , according to the criteria specified in Section 2.2 and Appendix 3 , a limited number of counterparties to participate in foreign exchange swaps .
-* the deposits are collected in order to absorb liquidity ;
the collection of deposits is normally executed in a decentralised manner by the national central banks ( the Governing Council of the ECB can decide whether , under exceptional circumstances , the bilateral collection of fixed-term deposits 3 may be executed by the ECB ) ; and the Eurosystem may select , according to the criteria specified in Section 2.2 , a limited number of counterparties for the collection of fixed-term deposits .
-* 3.5 COLLECTION OF FIXED-TERM DEPOSITS TYPE OF INSTRUMENT The Eurosystem may invite counterparties to place remunerated fixed-term deposits with the national central bank in the Member State in which the counterparty is established .
LEGAL NATURE The deposits accepted from counterparties are for a fixed term and with a fixed rate of interest .
No collateral is given by the national central banks in exchange for the deposits . INTEREST TERMS The interest rate applied to the deposit is a simple interest rate based on the day-count 3
Fixed-term deposits are held on accounts with the national central banks ; this would be the case even if such operations were to be executed in a centralised manner by the ECB .

CHAPTER 4 STANDING FACILITIES 4.1 THE MARGINAL LENDING FACILITY TYPE OF INSTRUMENT Counterparties may use the marginal lending facility to obtain overnight liquidity from national central banks at a pre-specified interest rate against eligible assets ( as set out in Chapter 6 ) .
LEGAL NATURE The national central banks may provide liquidity under the marginal lending facility either in the form of overnight repurchase agreements ( i.e. the ownership of the asset is transferred to the creditor , while the parties agree to reverse the transaction through a retransfer of the asset to the debtor on the next business day ) or as overnight collateralised loans ( i.e. an enforceable security interest is provided over the assets but , assuming fulfilment of the debt obligation , ownership of the asset is retained by the debtor ) .
ACCESS CONDITIONS Institutions fulfilling the general counterparty eligibility criteria specified in Section 2.1 may access the marginal lending facility .
Access to the marginal lending facility is granted only on days when TARGET2 1 is operational .
2 On days when the relevant SSSs are not operational , access to the marginal lending facilities is granted on the basis of underlying assets which have already been predeposited with the national central banks .
At the end of each business day , counterparties » debit positions on their settlement account with the national central banks are automatically considered to be a request for recourse to the marginal lending facility .
For the national central bank to process the request on the same day in TARGET2 , the request must be received by the national central bank at the latest 15 minutes following the TARGET2 closing time .
3 , 4 As a general rule , the TARGET2 closing time is 6 p.m. ECB time ( CET ) .
The deadline for requesting access to the marginal lending facility is postponed by an additional 15 minutes on the last Eurosystem business day of a reserve 1 Starting on 19 November 2007 , the decentralised technical infrastructure of TARGET has been replaced by the single shared platform of TARGET2 through which all payment orders are submitted and processed and through which payments are received in the same technical manner .
The composition of the country groups was the following : Group 1 ( 19 November 2007 ) : Austria , Cyprus , Germany , Luxemburg , Malta and Slovenia ;
Certain non-participating national central banks have also been connected to TARGET2 on the basis of a separate agreement : Latvia and Lithuania ( in Group 1 ) , as well as Denmark , Estonia and Poland ( in Group 3 ) .
In addition , access to the marginal lending facility is only granted when the requirements of the payment system infrastructure in the RTGS have been fulfilled .
In some Member States , the national central bank or some of its branches may not be open for the purpose of conducting monetary policy operations on certain Eurosystem business days due to national or regional bank holidays .
In such cases , the national central bank is responsible for informing the counterparties in advance of the arrangements to be made for access to the marginal lending facility on the bank holiday .
TARGET2 closing days are announced on the ECB 's website ( www.ecb.europa.eu ) , and on the Eurosystem websites ( see Appendix 5 ) . 2

The request must specify the amount of credit and , if underlying assets for the transaction have not already been predeposited with the national central bank , also the underlying assets to be delivered for the transaction .
MATURITY AND INTEREST TERMS The maturity of credit extended under the facility is overnight .
For counterparties participating directly in TARGET2 , the credit is repaid on the next day on which ( i ) TARGET2 ; and ( ii ) the relevant SSSs are operational , at the time at which those systems open .
The ECB may change the interest rate at any time , effective , at the earliest , from the following Eurosystem business day .
5 , 6 Interest under the facility is payable with the repayment of the credit .
SUSPENSION OF THE FACILITY Access to the facility is granted only in accordance with the objectives and general monetary policy considerations of the ECB . The ECB may adapt the conditions of the facility or suspend it at any time .
LEGAL NATURE The overnight deposits accepted from counterparties are remunerated at a fixed rate of interest .
ACCESS CONDITIONS 8 Institutions fulfilling the general counterparty eligibility criteria specified in Section 2.1 may access the deposit facility .
Access to the deposit facility is granted only on days when TARGET2 is open .
For the national central bank to process the request on the same day in TARGET2 , the request must be received by the national central bank at the latest 15 minutes following the TARGET2 closing time , which is , as a general rule , 6 p.m. ECB time ( CET ) .
9 , 10 The deadline for requesting access to the deposit facility is postponed by an additional 15 minutes on the last Eurosystem business day of a reserve maintenance period .
The request must specify the amount to be deposited under the facility .
4.2 THE DEPOSIT FACILITY TYPE OF INSTRUMENT Counterparties can use the deposit facility to make overnight deposits with national central banks . The deposits are remunerated at a pre-specified interest rate .
Under normal circumstances , the interest rate on the facility provides a floor for the overnight market interest rate . The terms and conditions of the deposit facility are identical throughout the euro area .
Throughout this document , the term « Eurosystem business day » refers to any day on which the ECB and at least one national central bank are open for the purpose of conducting Eurosystem monetary policy operations .
6 The Governing Council usually decides on interest rate changes when assessing its monetary policy stance at its first meeting of the month .
Usually such decisions become effective only from the beginning of the new reserve maintenance period .
7 Operational differences resulting from the existence of different account structures in the national central banks may exist across euro area countries .
8 Owing to the existence of different account structures across the national central banks , the ECB may allow national central banks to apply access conditions which are slightly different from those referred to here .

There is no limit to the amount a counterparty may deposit under the facility .
MATURITY AND INTEREST TERMS The maturity of deposits under the facility is overnight .
For counterparties participating directly in TARGET2 , deposits held under the facility mature on the next day on which TARGET2 is operational , at the time at which this system opens .
The ECB may change the interest rate at any time , effective , at the earliest , from the following Eurosystem business day .
11 Interest on the deposits is payable on maturity of the deposit .

CHAPTER 5 PROCEDURES 5.1 TENDER PROCEDURES 5.1.1 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS Eurosystem open market operations are normally executed in the form of tenders . The Eurosystem 's tender procedures are performed in six operational steps , as specified in Box 3 .
STANDARD TENDERS For standard tenders , a maximum of 24 hours elapses from the announcement of the tender to the certification of the allotment result ( where the time between the submission deadline and the announcement of the allotment result is approximately two hours ) .
Chart 1 gives an overview of the normal time frame for the operational steps for standard tenders .
The ECB The main refinancing operations , the longer-term refinancing operations and structural operations ( with the exception of outright transactions ) are always executed in the form of standard tenders .
QUICK TENDERS Quick tenders are normally executed within 90 minutes of the announcement of the tender , with certification taking place immediately after the announcement of the allotment result .
The Eurosystem may select , according to the criteria and procedures specified in Section 2.2 , a limited number of counterparties to participate in quick tenders . may decide to adjust the time frame in individual operations , if deemed appropriate .

FIXED RATE AND VARIABLE RATE TENDERS The Eurosystem has the option of conducting either fixed rate ( volume ) or variable rate ( interest ) tenders .
In a fixed rate tender , the ECB specifies the interest rate in advance and participating counterparties bid the amount of money they want to transact at the fixed interest rate .
1 In a variable rate tender , counterparties bid the amounts of money and the interest rates at which they want to enter into transactions with the national central banks .
2 5.1.2 TENDER OPERATIONS CALENDAR MAIN AND LONGER-TERM REFINANCING OPERATIONS The main and the longer-term refinancing operations are executed according to
an indicative calendar published by the Eurosystem . 3 The calendar is published at least three months before the start of the year for which it is valid .
The ECB aims to ensure that counterparties in all Member States can participate in the main and the longerterm refinancing operations .
Therefore , when 1 In fixed rate foreign exchange swap tenders , the ECB fixes the swap points of the operation and the counterparties offer the amount of currency kept fixed that they wish to sell ( and buy back ) or buy ( and sell back ) at that rate .
The calendar for the Eurosystem 's tender operations can be found on the ECB 's website ( www.ecb.europa.eu . ) , as well as on the Eurosystem websites ( see Appendix 5 ) .
CHAPTER 5 Table 2 Normal trade days for the main and the longer-term refinancing operations Type of operation Main refinancing operations Longer-term refinancing operations Normal trade day ( T ) Each Tuesday The last Wednesday of each calendar month 1 )
1 ) Owing to the Christmas period , the December operation is brought forward , normally by one week , i.e. to the preceding Wednesday of the month .
compiling the calendar for these operations , the ECB makes appropriate adjustments to the normal schedule to take into account bank holidays in the individual Member States . STRUCTURAL OPERATIONS Structural operations through standard tenders are not executed according to any pre-specified calendar .
However , they are normally conducted and settled only on days which are NCB business days 4 in all Member States . FINE-TUNING OPERATIONS Fine-tuning operations are not executed according to any pre-specified calendar .
5.1.3 ANNOUNCEMENT OF TENDER OPERATIONS Eurosystem standard tenders are publicly announced by means of wire services .
The public tender announcement message normally contains the following information : -* -* -* the reference number of the tender operation ;
the date of the tender operation ;
the type of operation ( provision or absorption of liquidity and the type of monetary policy instrument to be used ) ;
the maturity of the operation ;
-* the type of auction ( fixed rate or variable rate tender ) ;
the method of allotment (" Dutch » or « American » auction , as defined in Section 5.1.5 ) ;
the intended operation volume ( normally only in the case of longer-term refinancing operations ) ;
the fixed tender interest rate / price / swap point ( in the case of fixed rate tenders ) ;
the minimum / maximum accepted interest rate / price / swap point ( if applicable ) ;
the start date and maturity date of the operation ( if applicable ) , or the value date and maturity date of the instrument ( in the case of the issuance of debt certificates ) ;
the currencies involved and the currency , the amount of which is kept fixed ( in the case of foreign exchange swaps ) ;
the reference spot exchange rate to be used for the calculation of bids ( in the case of foreign exchange swaps ) ;
the maximum bid limit ( if any ) ;
the minimum individual allotment amount ( if any ) ;
Throughout this document , the term « NCB business day » refers to any day on which the national central bank of a specific Member State is open for the purpose of conducting Eurosystem monetary policy operations .
-* ECB The implementation of monetary policy in the euro area November 2008
-* -* -* the minimum allotment ratio ( if any ) ;
the time schedule for the submission of bids ;
the denomination of the certificates ( in the case of the issuance of debt certificates ) ; and the ISIN code of the issue ( in the case of the issuance of debt certificates ) .
In the case of a variable rate foreign exchange swap tender , the swap points must be quoted according to standard market conventions and bids must be expressed as multiples of 0.01 swap point .
For the main refinancing operations , the minimum bid amount is Euros 1,000,000 .
Bids exceeding this amount must be expressed as multiples of Euros 100,000 .
The same minimum bid and multiple amounts are applied in fine-tuning and structural operations . The minimum bid amount is applied to each individual interest rate / price / swap point level .
For the longer-term refinancing operations , each national central bank defines a minimum bid amount in the range from Euros 10,000 to Euros 1,000,000 .
Bids exceeding the defined minimum bid amount must be expressed as multiples of Euros 10,000 . The minimum bid amount is applied to each individual interest rate level .
The ECB may impose a maximum bid limit in order to prevent disproportionately large bids . Any such maximum bid limit is always specified in the public tender announcement message .
Counterparties are expected always to be in a position to cover the amounts allotted to them with a sufficient amount of eligible underlying assets .
8 The contractual or regulatory arrangements applied by the respective national central bank allow the imposition of penalties if a counterparty is unable to transfer a sufficient amount of underlying assets or cash to settle the amount it has been allotted in a tender operation .
With a view to enhancing transparency in its fine-tuning operations , the Eurosystem normally announces quick tenders publicly in advance . However , under exceptional circumstances , the ECB may decide not to announce quick tenders publicly in advance .
The announcement of quick tenders follows the same procedures as those for standard tenders . In a quick tender which is not announced publicly in advance , the selected counterparties are contacted directly by the national central banks .
In a quick tender , which is announced publicly , the national central bank may contact the selected counterparties directly .
5.1.4 PREPARATION AND SUBMISSION OF BIDS BY COUNTERPARTIES Counterparties » bids must be in a form that follows the pro forma example provided by the national central banks for the relevant operation .
The bids must be submitted to the national central bank of a Member State in which the institution has an establishment ( head office or branch ) .
The bids of an institution may only be submitted by one establishment ( either the head office or a designated branch ) in each Member State . In fixed rate tenders , counterparties must state in their bids the amount of money that they are willing to transact with the national central banks .
5 In variable rate tenders , counterparties may submit bids for up to ten different interest rate / price / swap point levels .
In each bid , they must state the amount of money that they are willing to transact with the national central banks and the respective interest rate . 6 , 7 The interest rates bid must be expressed as multiples of
In fixed rate foreign exchange swaps , the amount of the currency kept fixed that the counterparty is willing to transact with the Eurosystem must be stated .
With regard to the issuance of ECB debt certificates , the ECB may decide that bids are to be expressed in the form of a price rather than an interest rate .
In variable rate foreign exchange swaps , the amount of the currency kept fixed that the counterparty is willing to transact with the Eurosystem and the respective swap point level must be stated .
Or to settle in cash in the case of liquidity-absorbing operations . 26
CHAPTER 5 Bids are revocable up to the tender submission deadline . Bids submitted after the deadline specified in the tender announcement message are invalid .
Respect of the deadline is judged by the national central banks .
The national central banks discard all the bids of a counterparty if the aggregate amount bid exceeds any maximum bid limit established by the ECB .
5.1.5 TENDER ALLOTMENT PROCEDURES FIXED RATE TENDER OPERATIONS In the allotment of a fixed rate tender , the bids received from counterparties are added together .
VARIABLE RATE TENDERS IN EURO In the allotment of liquidity-providing variable rate tenders in euro , bids are listed in descending order of offered interest rates .

In the allotment of liquidity-absorbing variable rate foreign exchange swap tenders , bids are listed in descending order of offered swap point quotations . The bids with the highest swap point quotations are satisfied first and subsequently successively lower swap point quotations are accepted until the total amount of the fixed currency to be absorbed is exhausted .
TYPE OF AUCTION For variable rate tenders , the Eurosystem may apply either single rate or multiple rate auction procedures .
In a multiple rate auction ( American auction ) , the allotment interest rate / price / swap point is equal to the interest rate / price / swap point offered for each individual bid .
5.1.6 ANNOUNCEMENT OF TENDER RESULTS The results of standard and quick tenders are announced publicly by means of wire services .
The public tender result message normally contains the following information : -* the reference operation ; number of the tender
-* -* -* -* the date of the tender operation ;
the type of operation ;
the maturity of the operation ; the total amount bid by Eurosystem counterparties ;
the number of bidders ;
the currencies involved ( in the case of foreign exchange swaps ) ;
the total amount allotted ;
the percentage of allotment ( in the case of fixed rate tenders ) ;
the spot exchange rate ( in the case of foreign exchange swaps ) ;
the marginal interest rate / price / swap point accepted and the percentage of allotment at the marginal interest rate / price / swap point ( in the case of variable rate tenders ) ;
the minimum bid rate , maximum bid rate and weighted average allotment rate ( in the case of multiple rate auctions ) ; -* -*
CHAPTER 5 -* the start date and maturity date of the operation ( if applicable ) or the value date and maturity date of the instrument ( in the case of the issuance of debt certificates ) ;
the minimum allotment ratio ( if any ) ;
the denomination of the certificates ( in the case of the issuance of debt certificates ) ; and the ISIN code of the issue ( in the case of the issuance of debt certificates ) .
If the Governing Council of the ECB were to decide that , under exceptional circumstances , bilateral operations could also be executed by the ECB itself ( or by one or a few national central banks acting as the operating arm of the ECB ) , the procedures for such operations would be adapted accordingly .
In this case , the ECB ( or the national central bank ( s ) acting as the operating arm of the ECB ) would directly contact one or a few counterparties in the euro area , selected according to the criteria specified in Section 2.2 .
The ECB ( or the national central bank ( s ) acting as the operating arm of the ECB ) would decide whether to enter into a deal with the counterparties .
The transactions would nevertheless be settled in a decentralised manner through the national central banks .
Bilateral operations through direct contact with counterparties can be applied for reverse transactions , outright transactions , foreign exchange swaps and the collection of fixed-term deposits . OPERATIONS EXECUTED THROUGH STOCK EXCHANGES AND MARKET AGENTS The national central banks can execute outright transactions through stock exchanges and market agents .
For these operations , the range of counterparties is not restricted a priori and the procedures are adapted to the market conventions for the debt instruments transacted . ANNOUNCEMENT OF BILATERAL OPERATIONS Bilateral operations are normally not announced publicly in advance .
In addition , the ECB may decide not to announce the results of bilateral operations publicly .
OPERATING DAYS The ECB may decide to conduct fine-tuning bilateral operations on any Eurosystem business day .
Only national central banks of Member 10 The Governing Council of the ECB can decide whether , under exceptional circumstances , fine-tuning bilateral operations may also be executed by the ECB itself .
Procedures -*
The national central banks will directly certify the individual allotment result to successful counterparties . 5.2 PROCEDURES FOR BILATERAL OPERATIONS GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS The national central banks may execute operations on the basis of bilateral procedures .
10 These procedures may be used for fine-tuning open market operations and structural outright operations .
They are defined in a broad sense as any procedures where the Eurosystem conducts a transaction with one or a few counterparties without a tender .
In this respect , two different types of bilateral procedures can be distinguished : operations where counterparties are contacted directly by the Eurosystem , and operations executed through stock exchanges and market agents .
DIRECT CONTACT WITH COUNTERPARTIES In this procedure , the national central banks directly contact one or a few domestic counterparties , which are selected according to the criteria specified in Section 2.2 . According to the precise instructions given by the ECB , the national central banks decide whether to enter into a deal with the counterparties .
The transactions are settled through the national central banks . ECB The implementation of monetary policy in the euro area November 2008
States where the trade day , the settlement day and the reimbursement day are NCB business days participate in such operations .
Outright bilateral operations for structural purposes are normally only conducted and settled on days which are NCB business days in all Member States .
5.3.2 SETTLEMENT OF OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS Open market operations based on standard tenders ( i.e. main refinancing operations , longer-term refinancing operations and structural operations ) are normally settled on the first day following the trade day on which ( i ) TARGET2 ; and ( ii ) all relevant SSSs are open .
As a matter of principle , the Eurosystem aims to settle the transactions related to its open market operations at the same time in all Member States with all counterparties that have provided sufficient underlying assets . However , owing to operational constraints and the technical features of SSSs , the timing within the day of the settlement of open market operations may differ across the euro area .
The time of settlement of the main and the longer-term refinancing operations normally coincides with the time of reimbursement of a previous operation of corresponding maturity . The Eurosystem aims to settle open market operations based on quick tenders and bilateral procedures on the trade day .
For operational reasons , however , the Eurosystem may occasionally apply other settlement dates for these operations , in particular for outright transactions and foreign exchange swaps ( see Table 3 ) . 5.3.3 END-OF-DAY PROCEDURES The end-of-day procedures are specified in documentation related to TARGET2 .
As a general rule , the TARGET2 closing time is 6 p.m. ECB time ( CET ) . No further payment orders are accepted for processing in TARGET2 after the closing time , although remaining payment orders accepted before the closing time are still processed .
Counterparties » requests for access to the marginal lending facility or to the deposit facility must be submitted to the respective national central 11 The description of the standards for the use of eligible SSSs in the euro area and an updated list of the eligible links between these systems can be found on the ECB 's website ( www.ecb.europa.eu ) .
5.3 SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES 5.3.1 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS Money transactions relating to the use of Eurosystem standing facilities or to participation in open market operations are settled on the counterparties » accounts with the national central banks or on the accounts of settlement banks participating in TARGET2 . Money transactions are settled only after ( or at the moment of ) the final transfer of the assets underlying the operation .
This implies that underlying assets need either to have been pre-deposited in a safe custody account at the national central banks or to be settled with said national central banks on an intraday delivery-versus-payment basis . The transfer of underlying assets is executed via the counterparties » securities settlement accounts with SSSs fulfilling the ECB 's minimum standards .
11 Counterparties without a safe custody account with a national central bank or a securities settlement account with an SSS fulfilling the ECB 's minimum standards may settle the transactions of underlying assets through the securities settlement account or the safe custody account of a correspondent credit institution . Further provisions related to the settlement procedures are defined in the contractual arrangements applied by the national central banks ( or the ECB ) for the specific monetary policy instruments .

bank at the latest 15 minutes following the TARGET2 closing time .
The deadline for requesting access to the Eurosystem 's standing facilities is postponed by an additional 15 minutes on the last Eurosystem business day of a minimum reserve maintenance period .
Any negative balances on the settlement accounts in TARGET2 of eligible counterparties remaining after the finalisation of the end-of-day control procedures are automatically considered to be a request for recourse to the marginal lending facility ( see Section 4.1 ) .
CHAPTER 6 ELIGIBLE ASSETS 6.1 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS Article 18.1 of the Statute of the ESCB allows the ECB and the national central banks to transact in financial markets by buying and selling underlying assets outright or under repurchase agreements and requires all Eurosystem credit operations to be based on adequate collateral .
Consequently , all Eurosystem liquidity-providing operations are based on underlying assets provided by the counterparties either in the form of the transfer of ownership of assets ( in the case of outright transactions or repurchase agreements ) or in the form of a pledge , an assignment or a charge granted over relevant assets ( in the case of collateralised loans ) .
1 With the aims of protecting the Eurosystem from incurring losses in its monetary policy operations and of ensuring the equal treatment of counterparties , as well as of enhancing operational efficiency and transparency , underlying assets have to fulfil certain criteria in order to be eligible for Eurosystem monetary policy operations .
This single framework , also referred to as the « Single List » , entered into effect on 1 January 2007 and replaced the two-tier system which had been in place from the start of Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union .
2 The single framework comprises two distinct asset classes -- marketable assets and non-marketable assets .
The eligibility criteria for the two asset classes are uniform across the euro area and are set out in Section 6.2.3 To ensure that the two asset classes comply with the same credit standards , a Eurosystem credit assessment framework ( ECAF ) has been set up , which relies on different credit assessment sources .
6.2 ELIGIBILITY SPECIFICATIONS FOR UNDERLYING ASSETS The ECB establishes , maintains and publishes a list of eligible marketable assets .
4 For non-marketable assets , the ECB will publish neither a list of eligible assets nor a list of eligible debtors / guarantors . The Eurosystem only provides counterparties with advice regarding eligibility as Eurosystem collateral if already issued marketable assets or outstanding non-marketable assets are submitted to the Eurosystem as collateral .
Liquidity-absorbing outright and reverse open market operations are also based on underlying assets .
French fonds communs de créances ( FCCs ) that were incorporated in the tier one list and issued prior to 1 May 2006 will remain eligible for a transitional period until 31 December 2008 .
FCCs issued from 1 May 2006 are not eligible .
During the interim period until 31 December 2011 for a specific asset class of the non-marketable assets , credit claims , a limited number of eligibility and operational criteria may diverge across the euro area ( see Section 6.2.2 ) .
This list is published and updated daily on the ECB 's website ( www.ecb.europa.eu ) .

CHAPTER 6 6.2.1 ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR MARKETABLE ASSETS Debt certificates issued by the ECB and all debt certificates issued by the national central banks of the Eurosystem prior to the date of adoption of the euro in their respective Member State are eligible .
To determine the eligibility of other marketable assets , the following eligibility criteria are applied ( see also Table 4 ) : TYPE OF ASSET It must be a debt instrument having : ( a ) a fixed , unconditional principal amount ; 5 and ( b ) a coupon that cannot result in a negative cash flow .
Requirement ( a ) does not apply to asset-backed securities , with the exception of bonds issued by credit institutions in accordance with the criteria set out in Article 22 ( 4 ) of the UCITS Directive 6 ( referred to as « covered bank bonds ") .
The Eurosystem assesses the eligibility of assetbacked securities other than covered bank bonds against the following criteria .
The cash flow-generating assets backing the asset-backed securities must fulfil the following requirements : ( a ) the acquisition of such assets must be governed by the law of an EU Member State ;
( b ) they must be acquired from the originator or an intermediary by the securitisation special-purpose vehicle in a manner which the Eurosystem considers to be a « true sale » that is enforceable against any third party , and be beyond the reach of the originator and its creditors , including in the event of the originator 's insolvency ; and ( c ) they must not consist , in whole or in part , actually or potentially , of credit-linked notes or similar claims resulting from the transfer of credit risk by means of credit derivatives .
A tranche ( or sub-tranche ) is considered to be non-subordinated vis-à-vis other tranches ( or sub-tranches ) of the same issue if , in accordance with the priority of payment applicable after the delivery of an enforcement notice , as set out in the offering circular , no other tranche ( or sub-tranche ) is given priority over that tranche or sub-tranche in respect of receiving payment ( principal and interest ) , and thereby such tranche ( or sub-tranche ) is last in incurring losses among the different tranches or sub-tranches of a structured issue . The Eurosystem reserves the right to request from any relevant third party ( such as the issuer , the originator or the arranger ) any clarification and / or legal confirmation that it considers necessary to assess the eligibility of asset-backed securities .
Bonds with warrants or other similar rights attached are not eligible . Council Directive 85/611 / EEC of 20 December 1985 on the coordination of laws , regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities ( UCITS ) ( OJ L 375 , 31.12.1985 , p. 3 ) , as last amended by Directive 2005/1 / EC ( OJ L 79 , 24.3.2005 , p. 9 ) .
ECB The implementation of monetary policy in the euro area November 2008 35
CREDIT STANDARDS The debt instrument must meet the high credit standards specified in the ECAF rules for marketable assets , as set out in Section 6.3.2 .
PLACE OF ISSUE The debt instrument must be deposited / registered ( issued ) in the EEA with a central bank or with a central securities depository ( CSD ) which fulfils the minimum standards established by the ECB .
7 In case a marketable debt instrument is issued by a non-financial corporation 8 that is not rated by an accepted external credit assessment institution ( ECAI ) , the place of issue must be the euro area .
SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES The debt instrument must be transferable in book-entry form .
It must be held and settled in the euro area through an account with the Eurosystem or with an SSS that fulfils the standards established by the ECB , so that perfection and realisation are subject to the law of a euro area country . If the CSD where the asset is issued and the SSS where it is held are not identical , then the two institutions have to be connected by a link approved by the ECB .
9 ACCEPTABLE MARKETS The debt instrument must be admitted to trading on a regulated market as defined in the Directive 2004/39 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on markets in financial instruments , 10 or traded on certain non-regulated markets as specified by the ECB . 11 The assessment of non-regulated markets by the Eurosystem is based on three principles -- safety , transparency and accessibility .
12 , 13 TYPE OF ISSUER / GUARANTOR The debt instrument may be issued or guaranteed by central banks , public sector entities , private sector entities , or international or supranational institutions . Debt instruments other than covered bank bonds that are issued by credit institutions are only eligible if they are admitted to trading on a regulated market as defined above .
14,15 In the latter case , the debt instruments can only be considered eligible if the Eurosystem ascertains that its rights would be protected in an appropriate manner , as determined by the Eurosystem , under the laws of the respective non-EEA G10 country .
For this purpose , a legal assessment in a form and with substance acceptable to the Eurosystem will have 7 Since 1 January 2007 , international debt securities in global bearer form issued through the ICSDs Euroclear Bank ( Belgium ) and Clearstream Banking Luxembourg must , in order to be eligible , be issued in the form of New Global Notes ( NGNs ) and must be deposited with a Common Safekeeper ( CSK ) which is an ICSD or , if applicable , a CSD that fulfils the minimum standards established by the ECB .
International debt securities in global bearer form that were issued in the form of Classical Global Notes ( CGNs ) prior to 1 January 2007 and fungible securities issued under the same ISIN code on or after that date remain eligible until maturity .
Non-financial corporations are defined as in the European System of Accounts 1995 ( ESA 95 ) .

A list of acceptable non-regulated markets is published on the ECB 's website ( www.ecb.europa.eu ) and updated at least once a year .
« Safety » , « transparency » and « accessibility » are defined by the Eurosystem exclusively in terms of the performance of the Eurosystem 's collateral management function .
Marketable assets , which were accepted as tier two assets , and which have been issued prior to 31 May 2007 and are traded on non-regulated markets that currently fulfil the Eurosystem 's requirements for safety and accessibility , but not for transparency , remain eligible until 31 December 2009 , provided they fulfil the other eligibility criteria , and become ineligible after that date .
This does not apply to uncovered marketable assets issued by credit institutions that were accepted as tier two assets and became ineligible on 31 May 2007 .
Non-EEA G10 countries currently include the United States , Canada , Japan and Switzerland .
Marketable assets issued before 1 January 2007 by an entity not established in the EEA or in one of the non-EEA G10 countries , but guaranteed by an entity established in the EEA , remain eligible until 31 December 2011 , provided they fulfil the other eligibility criteria and the requirements applicable to guarantees as set out in Section 6.3.2 , and become ineligible after that date . 8 9

In the case of an asset-backed security , the issuer must be established in the EEA .
The guarantor must be established in the EEA .
International or supranational institutions are eligible issuers / guarantors irrespective of their place of establishment .
In case a marketable debt instrument is issued by a non-financial corporation that is not rated by an ECAI , the issuer / guarantor must be established in the euro area .
CURRENCY OF DENOMINATION The debt instrument must be denominated in euro .
16 6.2.2 ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR NON-MARKETABLE ASSETS Two types of non-marketable assets are eligible as collateral in the single framework for eligible assets : credit claims and non-marketable retail mortgage-backed debt instruments ( RMBDs ) .

Minimum size : At the time of submission for use as collateral ( mobilisation ) by the counterparty , the credit claim must meet a minimum size threshold . In an interim period ( 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2011 ) , each Eligible assets
16 Expressed as such or in the national denominations of the euro . 17 Between 1 January 2007 and 31 December 2011 , an intermediate regime will be in place for credit claims , allowing each national central bank to choose the minimum threshold for the size of credit claims eligible for collateral purposes ( apart from crossborder use ) and whether a handling fee should be applied .
As from 1 January 2012 , a unified regime will be in place . 18 Credit claims are also referred to as bank loans .
19 As defined in the ESA 95 . ECB The implementation of monetary policy in the euro area November 2008
national central bank may apply a minimum size of its choice for domestic credit claims . For cross-border use , a common minimum threshold of Euros 500,000 is applicable in the interim period .
As from 1 January 2012 a common minimum threshold of Euros 500,000 will be applicable to all credit claims throughout the euro area . -* Handling procedures : The credit claim must be handled according to the Eurosystem procedures as defined in the respective national documentation .
Governing laws : The credit claim agreement and the agreement between the counterparty and the national central bank mobilising the credit claim as collateral (" mobilisation agreement ") must both be governed by the law of a Member State belonging to the euro area . Furthermore , the total number of different governing laws that are applicable to ( i ) the counterparty , ( ii ) the creditor , ( iii ) the debtor , ( iv ) the guarantor ( if relevant ) , ( v ) the credit claim agreement and ( vi ) the mobilisation agreement may not exceed two .

-* 6.2.3 ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE USE OF ELIGIBLE ASSETS ADDITIONAL LEGAL REQUIREMENTS FOR CREDIT CLAIMS In order to ensure that a valid security is created over credit claims and that the credit claim can be swiftly realised in the event of a counterparty default , additional legal requirements have to be met .
These legal requirements relate to : -* the verification of the existence of credit claims ;
the notification of the debtor about the mobilisation of the credit claim or the registration of such mobilisation ;
the absence of restrictions related to banking secrecy and confidentiality ; the absence of restrictions on the mobilisation of the credit claim ;
NON-MARKETABLE RETAIL MORTGAGE-BACKED DEBT INSTRUMENTS The following eligibility criteria are applied to RMBDs ( see also Table 4 ) : -* Type of asset : It must be a debt instrument ( a promissory note or a bill of exchange ) that is secured by a pool of residential mortgages and that falls short of full securitisation . Substitution of assets in the underlying pool must be possible and a mechanism needs to be in place to ensure that the Eurosystem enjoys priority over creditors other than those exempted for public policy reasons .
21 The RMBD must have ( a ) a fixed , unconditional principal amount and ( b ) an interest rate that cannot result in a negative cash flow . -*
CHAPTER 6 The content of these legal requirements is set out in Appendix 7 .
RULES FOR THE USE OF ELIGIBLE ASSETS Marketable assets can be used for all monetary policy operations which are based on underlying assets , i.e. reverse and outright open market transactions and the marginal lending facility .
Irrespective of the fact that a marketable or nonmarketable asset fulfils all eligibility criteria , a counterparty may not submit as collateral any asset issued or guaranteed by itself or by any other entity with which it has close links .
23 « Close links » means a situation in which the counterparty is linked to an issuer / debtor / guarantor of eligible assets by reason of the fact that : ( i ) the counterparty owns directly , or indirectly through one or more other undertakings , 20 % or more of the capital of the issuer / debtor / guarantor ; or bonds issued in accordance with the criteria set out in Article 22 ( 4 ) of the UCITS Directive ;
Moreover , a counterparty may not submit as collateral any asset-backed security if the counterparty ( or any third party with which it has close links ) provides a currency hedge to the asset-backed security by entering into a currency hedge transaction with the issuer as a hedge counterparty or provides liquidity support for 20 % or more of the outstanding amount of the asset-backed security . Furthermore , in spite of their eligibility , national central banks may decide not to accept the following marketable or non-marketable assets as collateral : -* debt instruments falling due before the maturity date of the monetary policy operation for which they are being used as underlying assets ;
24 and debt instruments with an income flow ( e.g. a coupon payment ) occurring in the period up to the maturity date of the monetary policy operation for which they are being used as underlying assets . Eligible assets
( ii ) the issuer / debtor / guarantor owns directly , or indirectly through one or more other undertakings , 20 % or more of the capital of the counterparty ;
or ( iii ) a third party owns more than 20 % of the capital of the counterparty and more than 20 % of the capital of the issuer / debtor / guarantor , either directly or indirectly , through one or more undertakings .
The above provision on close links does not apply to : ( a ) close links between the counterparty and the public authorities of EEA countries or in the case where a debt instrument is guaranteed by a public sector entity which has the right to levy taxes ;
( b ) covered bank
All eligible marketable and non-marketable assets must be usable in a cross-border context throughout the euro area .
This implies that all Eurosystem counterparties must be able to 23 In the event of a counterparty using assets that , owing to an identity with the issuer / debtor / guarantor or the existence of close links , it may not or no longer use to secure an outstanding credit , it is obliged to immediately notify the relevant national central bank thereof .
The assets are valued at zero on the next valuation date and a margin call may be triggered ( see also Appendix 6 ) . In addition , the counterparty has to remove the asset on the earliest possible date .
24 If the national central banks were to allow the use of instruments with a maturity shorter than the monetary policy operations for which they serve as underlying assets , counterparties would be required to replace such assets at , or prior to , maturity . ECB The implementation of monetary policy in the euro area November 2008
use eligible assets either through links with their domestic SSSs in the case of marketable assets or through other eligible arrangements to receive credit from the national central bank of the Member State in which the counterparty is established ( see Section 6.6 ) .

CHAPTER 6 6.3 EUROSYSTEM CREDIT ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK collateral pool , transaction participants , capital structure ) , as well as performance data . The Eurosystem 's benchmark for establishing its minimum requirement for high credit standards ( its « credit quality threshold ") is defined in terms of a « single A » credit assessment .
26 The Eurosystem considers a probability of default ( PD ) over a one-year horizon of 0.10% as equivalent to a « single A » credit assessment , subject to a regular review .
The ECAF follows the definition of a default event given in the EU Capital Requirements Directive ( CRD ) .
27 The Eurosystem publishes the lowest rating grade meeting the required credit quality threshold for each accepted ECAI , without assuming any responsibility of its assessment of the ECAI , again subject to regular review .
The Eurosystem reserves the right to determine whether an issue , issuer , debtor or guarantor fulfils its requirements for high credit standards on the basis of any information it may consider relevant and may reject , limit the use of assets or apply supplementary haircuts on such grounds if required to ensure adequate risk protection of the Eurosystem in line with Article 18.1 of the Statute of the ESCB .
In case such a rejection is based on prudential information , the use of any such information transmitted either by counterparties or by supervisors must be strictly commensurate with , and necessary for , the performance of the Eurosystem 's tasks of conducting monetary policy .
25 For asset-backed securities whose underlying assets pay principal or interest at semi-annual or annual frequency , surveillance reports can follow a semi-annual or annual frequency respectively .
26 « Single A » means a minimum long-term rating of « A - » by Fitch or Standard & Poor 's , or « A3 » by Moody 's , or « AL » by DBRS .
27 The CRD comprises Directive 2006/48 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2006 relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions ( recast ) ( OJ L177 , 30.6.2006 , p. 1 ) and Directive 2006/49 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2006 on the capital adequacy of investment firms and credit institutions ( recast ) ( OJ L177 , 30.6.2006 , p. 201 ) . Eligible assets
25 These reports should at least contain an update of the key transaction data ( e.g. composition of the ECB The implementation of monetary policy in the euro area November 2008
Assets issued or guaranteed by entities that are subject to a freezing of funds and / or to other measures imposed by the European Community , or by a Member State under Article 60 ( 2 ) of the Treaty , restricting the use of their funds , or by entities in respect of which the ECB 's Governing Council has issued a decision suspending or excluding their access to open market operations or the Eurosystem 's standing facilities , may be excluded from the list of eligible assets .
6.3.2 ESTABLISHMENT OF HIGH CREDIT STANDARDS FOR MARKETABLE ASSETS The high credit standards for marketable assets are established on the basis of the following set of criteria : -* ECAI credit assessment : At least one credit assessment from an accepted ECAI ( as set out in Section 6.3.4 ) for the issue ( or , in its absence , for the issuer ) must comply with the Eurosystem 's credit quality threshold .
28 , 29 The ECB publishes the credit quality threshold for any accepted ECAI , as established under Section 6.3.1.30 Guarantees : In the absence of an ( acceptable ) ECAI credit assessment of the issuer , high credit standards can be established on the basis of guarantees provided by financially sound guarantors .
The guarantee must meet the following requirements : -- A guarantee is deemed acceptable if the guarantor has unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed the obligations of the issuer in relation to the payment of principal , interest and any other amounts due under the debt instruments to the holders thereof until they are discharged in full .
-- The guarantee has to be payable on first demand ( independently from the underlying debt obligation ) .
The obligations of the guarantor under the guarantee need to rank at least equally and rateably ( pari passu ) with all other unsecured obligations of the guarantor . -- The guarantee must be governed by the law of an EU Member State and be legally valid , binding and enforceable against the guarantor .
-- A legal confirmation concerning the legal validity , binding effect and enforceability of the guarantee will have to be submitted in a form and with substance acceptable to the Eurosystem before the asset supported by the guarantee can be considered eligible .
If the guarantor is established in a jurisdiction other than that of the law governing the guarantee , the legal confirmation must also confirm that the guarantee is valid and enforceable under the law governing the establishment of the guarantor .
The legal confirmation should be submitted for review to the national central bank that is reporting a certain asset supported by a guarantee for 28 If multiple and possibly conflicting ECAI assessments are available for the same issuer / debtor or guarantor , the first-best rule ( i.e. the best available ECAI credit assessment ) is applied .
29 The high credit standards for covered bank bonds issued from 1 January 2008 are assessed on the basis of the above-listed set of criteria .
Covered bank bonds issued prior to 1 January 2008 are deemed to fulfil high credit standards if they comply strictly with the criteria set out in Article 22 ( 4 ) of the UCITS Directive .

CHAPTER 6 inclusion in the list of eligible assets .
31 The need for a legal confirmation does not apply to guarantees given in respect of debt instruments with an individual asset rating or to guarantees given by public entities entitled to levy taxes .
In the absence of an ECAI credit assessment for the issue , issuer or guarantor , the high credit standards are established as follows : -* Euro area public sector issuers or guarantors : If a marketable asset is issued or guaranteed by a regional government , local authority or public sector entity ( PSE ) located in the euro area as defined in the CRD , the following procedure applies : -- The issuer or guarantor is allocated to one of three classes in accordance with the CRD 32 as explained in Table 5 .
-- An implicit credit assessment for issuers or guarantors belonging to classes 1 and 2 is derived from the ECAI credit assessment of the central government of the country where the issuer or guarantor is established . This implicit credit assessment has to meet the Eurosystem credit quality threshold .
No implicit credit assessment is derived for issuers / guarantors belonging to class 3 . -* Euro area non-financial corporate issuers or guarantors : If the high credit standards for marketable assets which are issued / guaranteed by non-financial corporations 33 located in the euro area cannot be established on the basis of an ECAI credit assessment for the issue , issuer or guarantor , the ECAF rules for credit claims will be applicable and counterparties are allowed to make use of their own IRB system , national central banks » in-house credit assessment systems or third-party rating tools .
Eligible assets 31 The national central bank reporting a certain asset is normally the national central bank of the country in which the asset will be admitted to trading / traded on an acceptable market .
In the event that an asset is admitted to trading / traded on multiple markets , any queries should be addressed to the ECB 's Eligible Assets Hotline ( Eligible-Assets.hotline@ecb.europa.eu ) .
32 Lists of entities belonging to the three classes , as well as the criteria for classifying issuers , debtors or guarantors into the three classes , are expected to be made available , together with links to the relevant websites of the national supervisory authorities , on the website of the Committee of European Banking Supervisors ( CEBS ) : www.c-ebs.org/SD/Rules_AdditionalInformation.htm 33 See footnote 8 in this chapter .

6.3.3 ESTABLISHMENT OF HIGH CREDIT STANDARDS FOR NON-MARKETABLE ASSETS CREDIT CLAIMS In order to establish the requirement for high credit standards for the debtors or guarantors of credit claims , counterparties have to select one main credit assessment source from among those that are available and accepted by the Eurosystem .
Counterparties wishing to change credit assessment sources after the minimum period of one year have to submit a reasoned request to the relevant national central bank .
Counterparties must inform the national central bank promptly of any credit event , including a delay of payments by the submitted debtors , that is known to the counterparty and , if necessary , withdraw or replace the assets .
Furthermore , counterparties are responsible for ensuring that they use the most recent credit assessment updates available from their selected credit assessment system or source for the debtors 34 or guarantors of submitted assets .
Credit assessments of debtors / guarantors : The high credit standards of the debtors or guarantors of credit claims are established according to rules differentiating between public sector and non-financial corporate debtors / guarantors : -* Public sector debtors or guarantors : The following rules are applied in a sequential order : ( i ) A credit assessment from the system or source selected by the counterparty exists and is used to establish whether the public sector debtor or guarantor meets the credit quality threshold .
( ii ) In the absence of a credit assessment under ( i ) , an ECAI credit assessment of the debtor or guarantor is used .
If a credit assessment from the system or source selected by the counterparty ( or from an ECAI in case ( ii ) for public sector debtors or guarantors ) exists but is below the credit quality threshold , the debtor or guarantor is ineligible .
34 In the case of marketable assets issued by non-financial corporations but not rated by an accepted ECAI , this requirement applies to the credit assessment of issuers .
35 See footnote 28 in this chapter .
36 See footnote 32 in this chapter . 44
ECB The implementation of monetary policy in the euro area November 2008 CHAPTER 6 -* Non-financial corporate debtors or guarantors : If the source selected by the counterparty provides a credit assessment equal to or exceeding the credit quality threshold , the debtor or guarantor is eligible .
37 , 38 the Eurosystem before the asset supported by the guarantee can be considered eligible . The legal confirmation should also state that the guarantee is not a personal one , only enforceable by the creditor of the credit claim .
If the guarantor is established in a jurisdiction other than that of the law governing the guarantee , the legal confirmation must also confirm that the guarantee is valid and enforceable under the law governing the establishment of the guarantor . The legal confirmation should be submitted for review to the national central bank in the jurisdiction of the law governing the credit claim .
The need for a legal confirmation does not apply to guarantees given by public entities entitled to levy taxes .
The requirement of enforceability is subject to any insolvency or bankruptcy laws , general principles of equity and other similar laws and principles applicable to the guarantor and generally affecting creditors » rights against the guarantor .
NON-MARKETABLE RETAIL MORTGAGE-BACKED DEBT INSTRUMENTS The high credit standards for non-marketable RMBDs must meet the Eurosystem 's credit quality threshold .
A jurisdiction-specific credit assessment framework for these debt instruments will be specified in the applicable national documentation by the national central banks .
6.3.4 ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA FOR CREDIT ASSESSMENT SYSTEMS The ECAF builds on credit assessment information from four sources . Under each source , there might be a set of credit assessment systems .
If a credit assessment from the system or source selected by the counterparty exists but is below the credit quality threshold , the debtor or guarantor is ineligible . If no credit assessment is available to establish the credit standards , the debtor or guarantor is considered ineligible .
Guarantees : A guarantee must meet the following requirements : -* A guarantee is deemed acceptable if the guarantor has unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed the obligations of the debtor in relation to the payment of principal , interest and any other amounts due under the credit claim to the holder thereof until they are discharged in full . In this regard , a guarantee deemed acceptable does not need to be specific to the credit claim but might apply to the debtor only , provided that it also covers the credit claim in question .
The guarantee has to be payable on first demand ( independently from the underlying credit claim ) . Guarantees given by public entities entitled to levy taxes should either be payable on first demand or otherwise provide for prompt and punctual payment following default .
The obligations of the guarantor under the guarantee need to rank at least equally and rateably ( pari passu ) with all other unsecured obligations of the guarantor .
The guarantee must be governed by the law of an EU Member State and be legally valid , binding and enforceable against the guarantor . A legal confirmation concerning the legal validity , binding effect and enforceability of the guarantee will have to be submitted in a form and with substance acceptable to
37 If the counterparty has chosen an ECAI as a credit assessment source , it may use the first-best rule ( see footnote 28 in this chapter ) . 38 For specific credit assessment systems , the credit quality threshold can be adjusted following the performance monitoring process ( see Section 6.3.5 ) .
The accepted ECAIs , ICASs and third-party RTs and their providers are listed on the ECB 's website ( www.ecb.europa.eu ) . 39 EXTERNAL CREDIT ASSESSMENT INSTITUTION SOURCE The ECAI source encompasses those institutions whose credit assessments may be used by credit institutions for determining the risk weight of exposures according to the CRD .
40 For the purposes of the ECAF , the general acceptance criteria for ECAIs are the following : -* ECAIs must be formally recognised by the relevant EU supervisory authority for the euro area countries in which they will be used , in line with the CRD .
ECAIs must fulfil operational criteria and provide relevant coverage so as to ensure the efficient implementation of the ECAF .
In particular , the use of their credit assessments is subject to the availability to the Eurosystem of information on these assessments , as well as information for the comparison and the assignment ( mapping ) of the assessments with the ECAF credit quality steps and the credit quality threshold and for the implementation of performance monitoring ( see Section 6.3.5 ) . Furthermore , the counterparty must inform the ICAS national central bank promptly about any credit event that is known only to the counterparty , including a delay of payments by the submitted debtors .
Moreover , in countries in which RMBDs are mobilised , the respective national central bank implements a credit assessment framework for this type of asset in accordance with the ECAF . Such frameworks are subject to a yearly performance monitoring process .
INTERNAL RATINGS-BASED SYSTEM SOURCE A counterparty intending to use an IRB system to assess the credit quality of the debtors , issuers or guarantors of eligible debt instruments has to obtain the permission of its home national central bank . For that purpose , it must file a request , together with the following documents : 41 -* A copy of the decision of the relevant banking supervisory authority within the EU authorising the counterparty to use its IRB system for capital requirement purposes on a consolidated or unconsolidated basis , together with any specific conditions for such use .
Such a copy is not requested when such information is transmitted directly by the relevant supervisory authority to the relevant national central bank .
Information on its approach to assigning probabilities of default to debtors , as well as data on the rating grades and associated one-year probabilities of default used to determine eligible rating grades .
A copy of the Pillar 3 ( market discipline ) information that the counterparty is required to publish on a regular basis in accordance with the requirements on market discipline under Pillar 3 of the Basel II framework and the CRD .
-* The Eurosystem reserves the right to decide whether it accepts an ECAI for its lending operations , making use , among other factors , of its performance monitoring process .
NCB IN-HOUSE CREDIT ASSESSMENT SYSTEM SOURCE The ICAS source currently consists of the four credit assessment systems operated by the Deutsche Bundesbank , the Banco de España , the Banque de France and the Oesterreichische Nationalbank .
National central banks deciding to develop their own ICAS would be subject to a validation procedure by the Eurosystem . ICASs are subject to the Eurosystem performance monitoring process ( see Section 6.3.5 ) .
-* 39 The Eurosystem only publishes the information in conjunction with its Eurosystem credit operations and does not assume any responsibility for its evaluation of the accepted credit assessment systems .
40 ECAIs are commonly referred to as rating agencies in financial markets . 41 If necessary , the listed documentation should be translated in a working language of the home national central bank .
CHAPTER 6 -* The name and the address of both the competent banking supervisor and the external auditor .
-* the annual update of the Pillar 3 ( market discipline ) information that the counterparty is required to publish on a regular basis in accordance with the requirements of the Basel II framework and the CRD .
information on the competent banking supervisor and the external auditor . Eligible assets
In addition to the information requirements for this process , the counterparty is under an obligation to communicate the following information on an annual basis ( or as and when required by the relevant national central bank ) unless such information is transmitted directly by the relevant supervisory authority to the relevant national central bank : -* a copy of the most up-to-date assessment of the counterparty 's IRB system by the counterparty 's supervisor translated into a working language of the home national central bank ;
any changes to the counterparty 's IRB system recommended or required by the supervisor , together with the deadline by which such changes must be implemented ;
This yearly communication has to be signed by the counterparty 's CEO , CFO or a manager of similar seniority , or by an authorised signatory on behalf of one of them .
THIRD-PARTY RATING TOOL SOURCE The RT source consists of third-party applications that assess the credit quality of debtors using , among other information , audited accounts .
Counterparties wishing to use a specific RT for ECAF purposes have to submit a request to their respective national central bank , using the appropriate template provided by the Eurosystem , complemented by additional documentation of the RT as specified in the application form .
The Eurosystem decides on the acceptance of the proposed RT . The decision is based upon the evaluation of the compliance with the acceptance criteria set by the Eurosystem .
42 Furthermore , the counterparty must inform the RT provider of any credit event that is known only to the counterparty , including a delay of payments by the submitted debtors .
The RT provider participating in the ECAF needs to subject itself by agreement to the Eurosystem performance monitoring process 43 42 The acceptance criteria are listed on the ECB 's website ( www .
( see Section 6.3.5 ) . The RT provider is obliged to set up and maintain the necessary infrastructure for monitoring the so-called static pool .
6.3.5 PERFORMANCE MONITORING OF CREDIT ASSESSMENT SYSTEMS The ECAF performance monitoring process consists of an annual ex post comparison of the observed default rate for the set of all eligible debtors ( the static pool ) and the credit quality threshold of the Eurosystem given by the benchmark PD .
It aims to ensure that the results from credit assessments are comparable across systems and sources .
The monitoring process takes place one year after the date on which the static pool was defined .
The first element of the process is the annual compilation by the credit assessment system provider of a static pool of eligible debtors , i.e. a pool consisting of all corporate and public debtors , receiving a credit assessment from the system satisfying the following condition : PD ( i , t ) ≤ 0.10% ( benchmark PD ( t )) All debtors fulfilling this condition at the beginning of period t constitute the static pool for t. At the end of the foreseen 12-month period , the realised default rate for the static pool of debtors at time t is computed . On an
annual basis , the rating system provider has to agree to submit to the Eurosystem the number of eligible debtors contained in the static pool at time t and the number of those debtors in the static pool ( t ) that defaulted in the subsequent 12-month period . The realised default rate of the static pool of a credit assessment system recorded over a one-year horizon serves as input to the ECAF performance monitoring process which comprises an annual rule and a multi-period assessment .
In case of a significant deviation between the observed default rate of the static pool and the credit quality threshold over an annual and / or a multi-annual period , the Eurosystem consults the rating system provider to analyse the reasons for that deviation . This procedure may result in a correction of the credit quality threshold applicable to the system in question .
The Eurosystem may decide to suspend or exclude the credit assessment system in cases where no improvement in performance is observed over a number of years . In addition , in the event of an infringement of the rules governing the ECAF , the credit assessment system will be excluded from the ECAF .
6.4 RISK CONTROL MEASURES 6.4.1 GENERAL PRINCIPLES Risk control measures are applied to the assets underlying Eurosystem credit operations in order to protect the Eurosystem against the risk of financial loss if underlying assets have to be realised owing to the default of a counterparty .
The risk control measures at the disposal of the Eurosystem are described in Box 7 .
CHAPTER 6 Box 7 Eligible assets
RISK CONTROL MEASURES The Eurosystem applies the following risk control measures : -* Valuation haircuts The Eurosystem applies « valuation haircuts » in the valuation of underlying assets .
Variation margins ( marking to market ) The Eurosystem requires the haircut-adjusted market value of the underlying assets used in its liquidity-providing reverse transactions to be maintained over time .
-* The following risk control measures may also be applied by the Eurosystem at any time if required to ensure adequate risk protection of the Eurosystem in line with Article 18.1 of the Statute of the ESCB : -* Initial margins The Eurosystem may apply initial margins in its liquidity-providing reverse transactions .
Limits in relation to issuers / debtors or guarantors The Eurosystem may apply limits to the exposure vis-à-vis issuers / debtors or guarantors .
Additional guarantees The Eurosystem may require additional guarantees from financially sound entities in order to accept certain assets .
Exclusion The Eurosystem may exclude certain assets from use in its monetary policy operations .
Box 7 ( continued )
Assets issued or guaranteed by entities that are subject to a freezing of funds and / or to other measures imposed by the European Community , or by a Member State under Article 60 ( 2 ) of the Treaty , restricting the use of their funds , or by entities in respect of which the ECB 's Governing Council has issued a decision suspending or excluding their access to open market operations or the Eurosystem 's standing facilities , may be excluded from the list of eligible assets .
The Eurosystem applies specific risk control measures according to the types of underlying assets offered by the counterparty . The ECB determines the appropriate risk control measures for both marketable and non-marketable eligible assets .
The risk control measures are broadly harmonised across the euro area 44 and ought to ensure consistent , transparent and nondiscriminatory conditions for any type of eligible asset across the euro area .
The Eurosystem reserves the right to apply additional risk control measures if required to ensure an adequate risk protection of the Eurosystem in line with Article 18.1 of the Statute of the ESCB .
Such risk control measures , which must be applied in a consistent , transparent and non-discriminatory manner , can also be applied at the level of individual counterparties if required to ensure such protection .
6.4.2 RISK CONTROL MEASURES FOR MARKETABLE ASSETS The risk control framework for eligible marketable assets includes the following main elements : -* Eligible marketable assets are allocated to one of five liquidity categories , based on issuer classification and asset type .
The allocation is described in Table 6 . 44 Owing to operational differences across Member States , some differences in terms of risk control measures may prevail .
For instance , in respect of the procedures for counterparties » delivery of underlying assets to the national central banks ( in the form of a pool of collateral pledged with the national central bank or as repurchase agreements based on individual assets specified for each transaction ) , minor differences may occur with regard to the timing of the valuation and other operational features of the risk control framework .
Furthermore , in the case of non-marketable assets , the precision of valuation techniques may differ , which is reflected in the overall level of haircuts ( see Section 6.4.3 ) .

Agency debt instruments 4 ) Supranational debt instruments 1 ) In general , the issuer classification determines the liquidity category . However , all asset-backed securities are included in category V , regardless of the classification of the issuer , and Jumbo covered bank bonds are included in category II , while traditional covered bank bonds and other debt instruments issued by credit institutions are included in categories III and IV .
2 ) Debt certificates issued by the ECB and debt instruments issued by the national central banks prior to the adoption of the euro in their respective Member State are included in liquidity category I. 3 ) Only instruments with an issuing volume of at least Euros 1 billion , for which at least three market-makers provide regular bid and ask quotes , fall into the asset class of Jumbo covered bank bonds .
4 ) Only marketable assets issued by issuers that have been classified as agencies by the ECB are included in liquidity category II .
Marketable assets issued by other agencies are included in liquidity category III . 50

Eligible assets * Individual debt instruments included in category V that are theoretically valued according to Section 6.5 are subject to an additional valuation haircut .
This haircut is directly applied at the level of theoretical valuation of the individual debt instrument in the form of a valuation markdown of 5 %. -*
Individual debt instruments are subject to specific valuation haircuts . The haircuts are applied by deducting a certain percentage from the market value of the underlying asset .
The haircuts applied to debt instruments included in categories I to IV differ according to the residual maturity and coupon structure of the debt instruments as described in Table 7 for eligible marketable fixed coupon and zero coupon debt instruments . 45 Individual debt instruments included in category V are subject to a unique haircut of 12 % regardless of the maturity or coupon structure .
Individual debt instruments included in category V that are theoretically valued according to Section 6.5 are subject to an additional valuation haircut . This haircut is directly applied at the level of theoretical
valuation of the individual debt instrument in the form of a valuation markdown of 5 %. -* The valuation haircuts applied to all marketable inverse floating rate debt instruments included in categories I to IV are the same and are described in Table 8 .
45 The valuation haircut levels applied to fixed coupon debt instruments are also applicable to debt instruments , the coupon of which is linked to a change in the rating of the issuer itself or to inflation-indexed bonds .
Coupon payments for which the resetting period is longer than one year are treated as fixed rate payments , with the relevant maturity for the haircut being the residual maturity of the debt instrument .

The valuation haircut applied to such an instrument is set equal to the highest of the haircuts applicable to debt instruments with the same residual maturity , and coupon payments of any one of the types occurring in the remaining life of the instrument are considered . No valuation haircuts are applied in liquidityabsorbing operations .
Depending on both the jurisdiction and the national operational systems , national central banks allow for the pooling of underlying assets and / or require the earmarking of the assets used in each individual transaction . In pooling systems , the counterparty makes a pool of sufficient underlying assets available to the central bank to cover the related credits received from the central bank , thus implying that individual assets are not linked to specific credit operations .
On a daily basis , national central banks calculate the required value of underlying assets taking into account changes in outstanding credit volumes , the valuation principles outlined in Section 6.5 and the required valuation haircuts .
If , after valuation , the underlying assets do not match the requirements as calculated on that day , symmetric margin calls are performed . In order to reduce the frequency of margin calls , national central banks may apply a trigger point .
If applied , this trigger point is 0.5% of the amount of liquidity provided .
Depending on the jurisdiction , national central banks may require margin calls to be effected either through the supply of additional assets or by means of cash payments .
This implies that if the market value of the underlying assets falls below the lower trigger point , counterparties have to supply additional assets ( or cash ) .
Similarly , if the market value of the underlying assets , following their revaluation , were to exceed the upper trigger point , the national central bank would return the excess assets ( or cash ) to the counterparty ( see Box 8 ) .
Box 8
CALCULATION OF MARGIN CALLS The total amount of eligible assets J ( for j = 1 to J ;
value Cj , t at time t ) a counterparty must provide for a set of liquidity-providing operations I ( for i = 1 to I ;
amount Li , t at time t ) is determined by the following formula : ∑ Li , t ≤ ∑ ( 1 -- hj ) Cj , t i = 1 j = 1 I J
( 1 )
where : hj is the valuation haircut applied to eligible asset j. 52
Let τ be the time period between revaluations . The margin call base at time t + τ equals : Mt + τ = ∑ Li , t + τ - ∑ ( 1 - hj ) Cj , t + τ i = 1 j = 1 I J
Let k = 0.5% denote the trigger .
In an earmarking system ( I = 1 ) , a margin call is effected when : Mt + τ >k .
Li , t + τ ( the counterparty pays the margin call to the national central bank ) ; or Mt + τ < - k .</p>
Li , t + τ ( the national central bank pays the margin call to the counterparty ) .
In a pooling system , the counterparty has to bring more assets into the pool if : I Mt + τ >k -* ∑ Li , t + τ i = 1
Conversely , the amount of intraday credit ( IDC ) available to the counterparty in a pooling system can be expressed as follows : IDC =- Mt + τ + k -* ∑ Li , t + τ ( if positive ) i = 1 I
-* In pooling systems , counterparties may substitute underlying assets on a daily basis . In earmarking systems , the substitution of underlying assets may be permitted by national central banks .
-* -* The ECB may at any time decide to remove individual debt instruments from the published list of eligible marketable assets . 47 differ according to the residual maturity , type of interest payment ( fixed or variable ) and the valuation methodology applied by the national central bank ( see Section 6.5 ) , as described in Table 9.48 The haircut applied to credit claims with variable rate interest payments is 7 %, irrespective of the valuation methodology applied by the national central bank .
47 If , at the time of exclusion from the list of eligible marketable assets , a debt instrument is being used in a Eurosystem credit operation , it will have to be removed as soon as possible .
48 The valuation haircuts applied to credit claims with fixed rate interest payments are also applicable to credit claims , the interest payments of which are linked to the inflation rate .

Interest payments for which the resetting period is longer than one year are treated as fixed rate payments , with the relevant maturity for the haircut being the residual maturity of the credit claim . -* The risk control measures applied to a credit claim with more than one type of interest payment depend only on the interest payments during the remaining life of the credit claim .
If there is more than one type of interest payment during the remaining life of the credit claim , the remaining interest payments are treated as fixed rate payments , with the relevant maturity for the haircut being the residual maturity of the credit claim . The national central banks apply the same trigger point ( if applicable ) for the execution of margin calls for marketable and non-marketable assets .
MARKETABLE ASSETS -* For each eligible marketable asset , the Eurosystem defines the most representative price source to be used for the calculation of the market value .
-* The value of a marketable asset is calculated on the basis of the most representative price on the business day preceding the valuation date .
The market or theoretical value of a debt instrument is calculated including accrued interest .
Depending on differences in national legal systems and operational practices , the treatment of income flows ( e.g. coupon payments ) related to an asset which are received during the life of a reverse transaction may differ between national central banks .
ECB The implementation of monetary policy in the euro area November 2008 CHAPTER 6 national central banks aim to ensure that the economic effect of the treatment of income flows is equivalent to a situation in which the income is transferred to the counterparty on the payment day .
49 NON-MARKETABLE ASSETS Non-marketable assets are assigned a value corresponding either to the theoretical price or to the outstanding amount .
52 -* In an earmarking system , as soon as a counterparty 's bid for credit is accepted by the national central bank of the Member State in which the counterparty is established ( i.e. the « home central bank ") , the counterparty instructs ( via its own custodian , if necessary ) the SSS in the country in which its marketable assets are held to transfer them to the central bank of that country for the account of the home central bank . Once the home central bank has been informed by the correspondent central bank that the collateral has been received , it transfers the funds to the counterparty .
6.6 CROSS-BORDER USE OF ELIGIBLE ASSETS Eurosystem counterparties may use eligible assets on a cross-border basis , i.e. they may obtain funds from the national central bank of the Member State in which they are established by making use of assets located in another Member State . Underlying assets must be usable on a cross-border basis throughout the euro area for the handling of all types of operations in which the Eurosystem provides liquidity against eligible assets .
This is the correspondent central banking model ( CCBM ) , under which national central banks act as custodians (" correspondents ") for each other ( and for the ECB ) in respect of assets accepted in their local depository or settlement system .
Specific solutions can be used for nonmarketable assets , i.e. credit claims and RMBDs , which cannot be transferred through an SSS .
50 The CCBM may be used to collateralise all kinds of Eurosystem credit operations .
In addition to the CCBM , eligible links between SSSs can be used for the cross-border transfer of marketable assets .
49 National central banks may decide not to accept debt instruments with an income flow ( e.g. a coupon payment ) occurring in the period up to the maturity date of the monetary policy operation as underlying assets in reverse transactions ( see Section 6.2.3 ) .
50 Details are provided in the brochure entitled « Correspondent central banking model ( CCBM ) procedure for Eurosystem counterparties » , which is available on the ECB 's website ( www.ecb.europa.eu ) .
51 Eligible assets may be used through an account of a central bank in an SSS located in a country other than that of the central bank in question if the Eurosystem has approved the use of such an account .
Since 1999 , De Nederlandsche Bank has been authorised to use its account with Euroclear Bank ( Belgium ) to settle collateral transactions in the Eurobonds issued in that ICSD .
Since August 2000 , the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland has been authorised to open such an account with Euroclear .

bank .
Where necessary to meet settlement deadlines , counterparties may be able to pre-deposit assets with correspondent central banks for the account of their home central bank using the CCBM procedures .
-* In a pooling system , the counterparty is able at any time to provide the correspondent central bank with marketable assets for the account of the home central bank .
Specific procedures for cross-border use have been developed for non-marketable assets , i.e. credit claims and RMBDs .
53 When credit claims are used as collateral in a cross-border context , a CCBM variant is applied to credit claims , which is based on a transfer of ownership to , an assignment to , a pledge in favour of the home central bank , or a charge in favour of the correspondent central bank acting as the agent for the home central bank .
In exceptional circumstances or when required for monetary policy purposes , the ECB may decide to extend CCBM 's closing time until TARGET2 closing time .
6.6.2 LINKS BETWEEN SECURITIES SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS In addition to the CCBM , eligible links between EU SSSs can be used for the cross-border transfer of marketable assets . 53 See footnote 50 in this chapter .
NCB A Information on collateral Credit Transfer instructions Counterparty A SSS A SSS A holds assets on an omnibus account in SSS B SSS B A direct or relayed link between two SSSs allows a participant in one SSS to hold securities issued in another SSS without being a participant in that other SSS .
54 Before these links can be used to transfer collateral for Eurosystem credit operations , they have to be assessed and approved against the standards for the use of EU SSSs .
55 , 56 From a Eurosystem perspective , the CCBM and the links between EU SSSs fulfil the same role of allowing counterparties to use collateral on a cross-border basis , i.e. both enable counterparties to use collateral to obtain credit from their home central bank , even if this collateral was issued in an SSS of another country .
Assets held through a link can be used for Eurosystem credit operations , as well as for any other purpose selected by the counterparty . When using links between SSSs , the counterparties hold the assets
on their own account with their home SSS and have no need for a custodian . 6.7 ACCEPTANCE OF NON-EURO DENOMINATED COLLATERAL IN CONTINGENCIES In certain situations the Governing Council may decide to accept as eligible collateral certain marketable debt instruments issued by one or more non-euro area G10 central governments in their domestic currency .
Upon such decision , the applicable criteria shall be clarified and the procedures to be applied for the selection and mobilisation of foreign collateral , including the sources and principles of valuation , the risk 54 A link between two SSSs consists of a set of procedures and arrangements for the cross-border transfer of securities through a book-entry process .
55 The updated list of eligible links can be found on the ECB 's website ( www.ecb.europa.eu ) .

control measures and the settlement procedures , must also be communicated to counterparties .
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6.2.1 , such assets may be deposited / registered ( issued ) , held and settled outside the EEA and may , as stated above , be denominated in currencies other than the euro .
Counterparties that are branches of credit institutions located outside the EEA or Switzerland cannot use such assets as collateral . 58
CHAPTER 7 MINIMUM RESERVES 1 7.1 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS The ECB requires credit institutions to hold minimum reserves on accounts with the national central banks within the framework of the Eurosystem 's minimum reserve system .
The legal framework for this system is laid down in Article 19 of the Statute of the ESCB , Council Regulation ( EC ) No 2531/98 of 23 November 1998 concerning the application of minimum reserves by the European Central Bank 2 and Regulation ( EC ) No 1745/2003 of the European Central Bank on the application of minimum reserves ( ECB / 2003/9 ) .
3 The application of Regulation ECB / 2003/9 ensures that the terms and conditions of the Eurosystem 's minimum reserve system are uniform throughout the euro area .
The Eurosystem 's minimum reserve system enables counterparties to make use of averaging provisions , implying that compliance with reserve requirements is determined on the basis of the average of the endof-calendar-day balances on the counterparties » reserve accounts over a maintenance period .
The Eurosystem 's minimum reserve system primarily pursues the following monetary functions : -* Stabilisation of money market interest rates : The averaging provision of the Eurosystem 's minimum reserve system aims to contribute to the stabilisation of money market interest rates by giving institutions an incentive to smooth the effects of temporary liquidity fluctuations .
Creation or enlargement of a structural liquidity shortage : The Eurosystem 's minimum reserve system contributes to creating or enlarging a structural liquidity shortage . This may be helpful in improving the ability of the Eurosystem to operate efficiently as a supplier of liquidity .
In the application of minimum reserves , the ECB is bound to act in pursuance of the objectives of the Eurosystem as defined in Article 105 ( 1 ) of the Treaty and Article 2 of the Statute of the ESCB , which implies , inter alia , the principle of not inducing significant undesirable delocation or disintermediation .
CHAPTER 7 Minimum reserves
7.2 INSTITUTIONS SUBJECT TO MINIMUM RESERVE REQUIREMENTS Pursuant to Article 19.1 of the Statute of the ESCB , the ECB requires credit institutions established in Member States to hold minimum reserves .
According to Council Regulation ( EC ) No 2531/98 and Regulation ECB / 2003/9 , the ECB may also exempt institutions from their obligations under the Eurosystem 's minimum reserve system on a non-discriminatory basis if they are subject to reorganisation measures or the freezing of funds and / or other measures imposed by the European Community or by a Member State under Article 60 ( 2 ) of the Treaty restricting the use of their funds or in respect of which the ECB 's Governing Council issued a decision 1 2 3 The content of this chapter is provided for information purposes only .

suspending or excluding their access to open market operations or the Eurosystem 's standing facilities or if the purposes of the Eurosystem 's minimum reserve system would not be met by imposing these obligations on those particular institutions .
If its decision on any such exemption is based on the purposes of the Eurosystem 's minimum reserve system , the ECB takes into account one or more of the following criteria : -* the institution is authorised to pursue special purpose functions only ;
the institution is prohibited from exercising active banking functions in competition with other credit institutions ; and / or the institution is under a legal obligation to have all its deposits earmarked for purposes related to regional and / or international development assistance .
7.3 DETERMINATION OF MINIMUM RESERVES RESERVE BASE AND RESERVE RATIOS The reserve base of an institution is defined in relation to elements of its balance sheet .
The balance sheet data are reported to the national central banks within the general framework of the ECB 's money and banking statistics ( see Section 7.5 ) .
5 For institutions subject to full reporting requirements , the balance sheet data referring to the end of a given calendar month are used to determine the reserve base for the maintenance period starting in the calendar month two months later .
For these institutions , the balance sheet data reported for a specific quarter are used to determine , with a lag of two months , the reserve base for the consecutive three reserve maintenance periods .
According to Council Regulation ( EC ) No 2531/98 , the ECB is entitled to include liabilities resulting from the acceptance of funds together with liabilities resulting from off-balance-sheet items in the reserve base of institutions .
4 5 The lists are available to the public on the ECB 's website ( www.ecb.europa.eu ) . The reporting framework for the ECB 's money and banking statistics is presented in Appendix 4 .
-* The ECB establishes and maintains a list of institutions subject to the Eurosystem 's minimum reserve system .
The ECB also makes public a list of any institutions exempt from their obligations under this system for reasons other than their being subject to reorganisation measures or the freezing of funds and / or other measures imposed by the European Community or by a Member State under Article 60 ( 2 ) of the Treaty restricting the use of their funds or in respect of which the ECB 's Governing Council issued a decision suspending or excluding their access to open market operations or the Eurosystem 's standing facilities .
4 Counterparties may rely on these lists in deciding whether their liabilities are owed to another institution that is itself subject to reserve requirements .
The lists , available to the public after close of business on the last Eurosystem business day of each calendar month , are valid for the calculation of the reserve base for the maintenance period beginning in the calendar month two months later . For example , the list published at the end of February would be valid for the calculation of the reserve base for the maintenance period beginning in April .

CHAPTER 7 Box 9 Minimum reserves
RESERVE BASE AND RESERVE RATIOS A. Liabilities included in the reserve base and to which the positive reserve ratio is applied Deposits 1 -* Overnight deposits -* Deposits with an agreed maturity of up to and including two years -* Deposits redeemable at notice of up to and including two years Debt securities issued -* Debt securities with an original maturity of up to and including two years B. Liabilities included in the reserve base and to which a zero reserve ratio is applied Deposits 1 -* Deposits with an agreed maturity of over two years -* Deposits redeemable at notice of over two years -* Repos Debt securities issued -* Debt securities with an original maturity of over two years C. Liabilities excluded from the reserve base -* Liabilities vis-à-vis other institutions subject to the Eurosystem 's minimum reserve system -* Liabilities vis-à-vis the ECB and the participating national central banks 1 Regulation ( EC ) No 2181/2004 of the European Central Bank of 16 December 2004 , amending Regulation ( EC ) No 2423/2001 ( ECB / 2001/13 ) concerning the consolidated balance sheet of the monetary financial institutions sector and Regulation ( EC ) No 63/2002 ( ECB / 2001/18 ) concerning statistics on interest rates applied by monetary financial institutions to deposits and loans vis-àvis households and non financial corporations ( ECB / 2004/21 ) ( OJ L 371 , 18.12.2004 , p. 42 ) , explicitly requires the reporting of deposit liabilities at nominal value .
This amendment had become necessary because Council Directive 86/635 / EEC of 8 December 1986 on the annual accounts and the consolidated accounts of banks and other financial institutions ( OJ L 372 , 31.12.1986 , p. 1 ) had been amended to the effect that certain financial instruments could be priced at fair value .
Liabilities vis-à-vis other institutions included in the list of institutions subject to the Eurosystem 's minimum reserve system and liabilities vis-à-vis the ECB and the participating national central banks are not included in the reserve base .
In this respect , for the liability category « debt securities issued » , the issuer needs to be able to prove the actual amount of these instruments held by other institutions subject to the Eurosystem 's minimum reserve system in order to be entitled to deduct them from the reserve base . If such proof cannot be presented , issuers may apply a standardised deduction of a fixed percentage 6 to this balance sheet item .
The reserve ratios are determined by the ECB subject to the maximum limit specified in Council Regulation ( EC ) No 2531/98 .
The ECB applies a uniform non-zero reserve ratio to most of the items included in the reserve base . This reserve ratio is specified in the Regulation ECB / 2003/9 .
The ECB sets a zero reserve ratio on the following liability categories : « deposits with an agreed maturity of over two years » , « deposits redeemable at notice of over two years » , « repos » and « debt securities with an original maturity of over two years » ( see Box 9 ) . The ECB may change the reserve ratio at any time .
Further information relating to the standardised deduction ratio can be found on the ECB 's website ( www.ecb.europa.eu ) , as well as on the Eurosystem websites ( see Appendix 5 ) . ECB The implementation of monetary policy in the euro area November 2008
CALCULATION OF RESERVE REQUIREMENTS The reserve requirement of each individual institution is calculated by applying , to the amount of eligible liabilities , the reserve ratios for the corresponding categories of liabilities . Each institution deducts an allowance of Euros 100,000 from its reserve requirement in each Member State in which it has an establishment .
7 The reserve requirement for each maintenance period is rounded to the nearest euro . Institutions » settlement accounts with the national central banks may be used as reserve accounts .
REMUNERATION OF RESERVE HOLDINGS Holdings of required reserves are remunerated at the average , over the maintenance period , of the ECB 's rate ( weighted according to the number of calendar days ) on the main refinancing operations , calculated using the formula specified in Box 10 .
Reserve holdings exceeding the required reserves are not remunerated .
The remuneration is paid on the second NCB business day following the end of the maintenance period over which the remuneration was earned . 7.4 MAINTENANCE OF RESERVE HOLDINGS MAINTENANCE PERIOD The ECB publishes a calendar of the reserve maintenance periods at least three months before the start of each year .
8 The maintenance period begins on the settlement day of the first main refinancing operation following the meeting of the Governing Council , at which the monthly assessment of the monetary policy stance is pre-scheduled .
Under special circumstances , the published calendar may be amended , depending , among other things , on changes in the schedule of Governing Council meetings . RESERVE HOLDINGS Each institution must hold its minimum reserves on one or more reserve accounts with the national central bank in the Member State in which it is established .
For institutions with more than one establishment in a Member State , the head office is responsible for fulfilling the aggregate minimum reserves of all the domestic establishments of the institution .
9 An institution with establishments in more than one Member State is required to hold minimum reserves with the national central bank of each Member State in which it has an establishment , in relation to its reserve base in the corresponding Member State . 7
For institutions allowed to report statistical data as a group on a consolidated basis according to the provisions of the reporting framework for the ECB 's money and banking statistics ( see Appendix 4 ) , only one such allowance will be granted to the group as a whole , unless the institutions provide data on the reserve base and reserve holdings in a sufficiently detailed manner to enable the Eurosystem to verify their accuracy and quality and to determine the respective reserve requirement of each individual institution included in the group . The calendar is normally announced in an ECB press release , to be found on the ECB 's website ( www.ecb.europa.eu ) .
In addition , such a calendar is published in the Official Journal of the European Union and on the Eurosystem websites ( see Appendix 5 ) . If an institution has no head office in a Member State in which it is established , it has to designate a principal branch which would then be responsible for fulfilling the aggregate minimum reserve requirements of all the establishments of the institution in the relevant Member State .
MRi = marginal interest rate for the most recent main refinancing operation settled on or before calendar day i. 7.5 REPORTING , ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND VERIFICATION OF THE RESERVE BASE The reserve base items for the application of minimum reserves are calculated by the institutions subject to minimum reserves themselves and are reported to the national central banks within the general framework of the ECB 's money and banking statistics ( see Appendix 4 ) .
The notified party shall acknowledge the calculated minimum reserves at the latest on the NCB business day preceding the start of the maintenance period .
If the notified party has not replied to the notification by the end of the NCB business day preceding the start of the maintenance period , it shall be deemed to have acknowledged the amount of minimum reserves of the institution for the relevant maintenance period . Once acknowledged , the institution 's minimum reserves for the relevant maintenance period cannot be revised .
63 For institutions that are allowed to act as intermediaries for indirect reserve holdings of other institutions , special reporting requirements are specified in Regulation ECB / 2003/9 .
The holding of reserves through an intermediary does not change the statistical reporting obligations of institutions holding reserves via an intermediary . The ECB and the national central banks have the right , within the scope of Council Regulation ( EC ) No 2531/98 , to verify the accuracy and quality of collected data .
during which the institution failed to comply with the reserve requirement .
Where an institution fails to comply with other obligations under ECB Regulations and Decisions related to the Eurosystem 's minimum reserve system ( e.g. if relevant data are not transmitted in time or are not accurate ) , the ECB is empowered to impose sanctions in accordance with Council Regulation ( EC ) No 2532/98 of 23 November 1998 concerning the powers of the European Central Bank to impose sanctions and European Central Bank Regulation ( EC ) No 2157/1999 of 23 September 1999 on the powers of the European Central Bank to impose sanctions ( ECB / 1999/4 ) .
10 The Executive Board of the ECB may specify and publish the criteria according to which it will apply the sanctions provided for in Article 7 ( 1 ) of Council Regulation ( EC ) No 2531/98 . 11 In addition , in the case of serious infringements of the minimum reserve requirements , the Eurosystem may suspend counterparties from participation in open market operations .
7.6 NON-COMPLIANCE WITH MINIMUM RESERVE OBLIGATIONS Non-compliance with the minimum reserve obligations arises if an institution 's average end-of-calendar-day balance on its reserve account ( s ) over the maintenance period is less than its reserve requirement for the corresponding maintenance period . Where an institution fails to comply with all or part of the reserve requirement , the ECB may , in accordance with Council Regulation ( EC ) No 2531/98 , impose any one of the following sanctions : -* a payment of up to 5 percentage points above the marginal lending rate , applied to the amount of the reserve requirement which the relevant institution failed to provide ;
-* 10 OJ L 264 , 12.10.1999 , p. 21 .

APPENDIX 1 Example 6 Examples of monetary policy opertations and procedures
RISK CONTROL MEASURES This example illustrates the risk control framework applied to underlying assets used in the Eurosystem 's liquidity-providing operations .
1 The example is based on the assumption that a counterparty participates in the following Eurosystem monetary policy operations : -* a main refinancing operation starting on 28 July 2004 and ending on 4 August 2004 where the counterparty is allotted Euros 50 million at an interest rate of 4.24% ;
a longer-term refinancing operation starting on 29 July 2004 and ending on 21 October 2004 where the counterparty is allotted Euros 45 million at an interest rate of 4.56% ; and a main refinancing operation starting on 4 August 2004 and ending on 11 August 2004 where the counterparty is allotted Euros 35 million at an interest rate of 4.26% .

Earmarking system First , it is assumed that the transactions are carried out with a national central bank using a system where underlying assets are earmarked for each transaction .
On 28 July 2004 , the counterparty enters into a repurchase transaction with the national central bank , which purchases Euros 50.6 million of Asset A. Asset A is a Jumbo covered bank bond with a fixed coupon maturing on 30 August 2008 . It thus has a residual maturity of four years , therefore requiring a valuation haircut of 3.5% .
The market price of Asset A on its reference market on that day is 102.63% , which includes the accrued interest on the coupon . 1 The example is based on the assumption that , in the calculation of the need for a margin call , accrued interest on the liquidity provided is taken into account and a trigger point of 0.5% of the liquidity provided is applied .
The counterparty is required to provide an amount of Asset A , which -- after deduction of the 3.5% valuation haircut -- exceeds the allotted amount of Euros 50 million .
The counterparty therefore delivers Asset A for a nominal amount of Euros 50.6 million , the adjusted market value of which is Euros 50,113,203 on that day .
On 29 July 2004 , the counterparty enters into a repurchase transaction with the national central bank , which purchases Euros 21 million of Asset A ( market price 101.98% , valuation haircut 3.5% ) and Euros 25 million of Asset B ( market price 98.35% ) .
Asset B is a central government bond with variable rate coupon payments , to which a 0.5% valuation haircut is applied .
The adjusted market value of Asset A and Asset B on that day is Euros 45,130,810 , thus exceeding the required amount of Euros 45,000,000 .
With a market price of 101.98% , the haircut-adjusted market value of Asset A is still within the lower and upper trigger amounts .
The initially pledged collateral is consequently considered to cater for both the initial amount of liquidity provided and the accrued interest amounting to Euros 5,889 .
On 30 July 2004 , the underlying assets are revalued : the market price of Asset A is 100.55% and the market price of Asset B is 97.95% .
Accrued interest amounts to Euros 11,778 on the main refinancing operation initiated on 28 July 2004 and Euros 5,700 on the longer-term refinancing operation initiated on 29 July 2004 .
As a result , the adjusted market value of Asset A in the first transaction falls below the transaction 's amount to be covered ( i.e. the liquidity provided plus the accrued interest ) by Euros 914,218 , but also below the lower trigger level of Euros 49,761,719 .
The counterparty delivers Euros 950,000 of Asset A in nominal value terms , which -- after deducting a 3.5% haircut from the market value based on a price of 100.55% -- restores sufficient collateral coverage .
2 A margin call is also needed on the second transaction since the adjusted market value of the underlying assets used in this transaction ( Euros 44,741,520 ) is below the lower trigger level ( Euros 44,780,672 ) .
The counterparty therefore provides Euros 270,000 of Asset B with an adjusted market value of Euros 263,143 .
On 4 August 2004 , the counterparty repays the liquidity provided under the main refinancing operation initiated on 28 July 2004 , including the accrued interest of Euros 41,222 .
The national central bank returns Euros 51,550,000 of Asset A in nominal value .
On the same day , the counterparty enters into a new repurchase transaction with the national central bank , which purchases Euros 75 million of Asset C in nominal value terms . Since Asset C is a zero coupon corporate bond with a residual maturity of more than ten years that requires
APPENDIX 1 Example 6 ( continued ) Examples of monetary policy opertations and procedures a valuation haircut of 15 %, the corresponding haircut-adjusted market value on that day is of Euros 35,068,875 .
The revaluation of assets underlying the long-term refinancing operation initiated on 29 July 2004 reveals that the adjusted market value of the assets provided exceeds the upper trigger level by approximately Euros 262,000 and leads to the national central bank returning Euros 262,000 of Asset B in nominal value to the counterparty .
3 Pooling system Second , it is assumed that the transactions are carried out with a national central bank using a pooling system .
The margin call of Euros 1,178,398 occurring on 30 July 2004 is identical in this example to the one required in the earmarking system case .
The counterparty delivers Euros 1,300,000 of Asset A in nominal value terms , which -- after deducting a 3.5% haircut from the market value based on a price of 100.55% -- restores sufficient collateral coverage .
An asset can also be exchanged for another asset as shown in the example , where Euros 51.9 million of Asset A in nominal value are replaced with Euros 75.5 million of Asset C in nominal value to cover the liquidity provided and the accrued interest under all refinancing operations .
3 If a margin had to be paid to the counterparty by the national central bank in relation to the second transaction , such a margin could , in certain cases , be netted out with the margin paid to the national central bank by the counterparty in relation to the first transaction .

In practice , most national central banks require additional collateral whenever the haircut-adjusted market value of the collateral pool falls below the total amount to be covered .
APPENDIX 2 GLOSSARY Asset-backed security ( ABS ) : a debt instrument that is backed by a pool of ring-fenced financial assets ( fixed or revolving ) that convert into cash within a finite time period . In addition , rights or other assets may exist that ensure the servicing or timely distribution of proceeds to the holders of the securities .
Generally , asset-backed securities are issued by a specially created investment vehicle which has acquired the pool of financial assets from the originator / seller .
In this regard , payments on the asset-backed securities depend primarily on the cash flows generated by the assets in the underlying pool and other rights designed to assure timely payment , such as liquidity facilities , guarantees or other features generally known as credit enhancements . Actual / 360 : the day-count convention applied for the calculation of interest on a credit , implying that the interest is calculated over the actual number of calendar days over which the credit is extended , on the basis of a 360-day year .
This day-count convention is applied in Eurosystem monetary policy operations . American auction : see multiple rate auction .
Averaging provision : a provision allowing counterparties to fulfil their reserve requirements on the basis of their average reserve holdings over the maintenance period . The averaging provision contributes to the stabilisation of money market interest rates by giving institutions an incentive to smooth the effects of temporary liquidity fluctuations .
The Eurosystem 's minimum reserve system provides for averaging . Bilateral procedure : a procedure whereby the central bank deals directly with only one or a few counterparties , without making use of tender procedures .
Bilateral procedures include operations executed through stock exchanges or market agents . Book-entry system : an accounting system that permits the transfer of securities and other financial assets without the physical movement of paper documents or certificates ( e.g. the electronic transfer of securities ) .
See also dematerialisation . Central securities depository ( CSD ) : an entity which holds and administers securities or other financial assets , holds the issuance accounts , and enables transactions to be processed by book entry .
Assets may exist either physically ( but immobilised within the CSD ) or in a dematerialised form ( i.e. only as electronic records ) .
Close links : a situation in which the counterparty is linked to an issuer / debtor / guarantor of debt instruments by reason of the fact that : ( i ) the counterparty owns 20 % or more of the capital of the issuer / debtor / guarantor , or one or more undertakings in which the counterparty owns the majority of the capital own 20 % or more of the capital of the issuer / debtor / guarantor , or the counterparty and one or more undertakings in which the counterparty owns the majority of the capital together own 20 % or more of the capital of the issuer / debtor / guarantor ;
or ( ii ) the issuer / debtor / guarantor owns 20 % or more of the capital of the counterparty , or one or more undertakings in which the issuer / debtor / guarantor owns the majority of the capital own 20 % or more of the capital of the counterparty , or the issuer / debtor / guarantor and one or more undertakings in which the issuer / debtor / guarantor owns the majority of the capital together own 20 % or more of the capital of the counterparty ;
or ( iii ) a third party owns both the majority of the capital of the counterparty and the majority of the capital of the issuer / debtor / guarantor , either directly , or indirectly through one or more undertakings in which that third party owns the majority of the capital .
ECB The implementation of monetary policy in the euro area November 2008 APPENDIX 2 Collateral pooling system : a central bank system for managing collateral , in which counterparties open a pool account to deposit assets collateralising their transactions with the central bank .
In a pooling system , by contrast with an earmarking system , the underlying assets are not earmarked for individual transactions . Collection of fixed-term deposits : a monetary policy instrument that may be used by the Eurosystem for fine-tuning purposes , where the Eurosystem offers remuneration on counterparties » fixed-term deposits on accounts with the national central banks in order to absorb liquidity from the market .
Correspondent banking : an arrangement under which one credit institution provides payment and other services to another credit institution . Payments through correspondents are often executed through reciprocal accounts ( nostro and loro accounts ) to which standing credit lines may be attached .
Correspondent banking services are primarily provided across international boundaries but are also known as agency relationships in some domestic contexts . A loro account is the term used by a correspondent to describe an account held on behalf of a foreign credit institution ;
the foreign credit institution would in turn regard this account as its nostro account .
Correspondent central banking model ( CCBM ) : a mechanism established by the Eurosystem with the aim of enabling counterparties to use underlying assets in a cross-border context . In the CCBM , national central banks act as custodians for one another .
This means that each national central bank has a securities account in its securities administration for each of the other national central banks and the ECB .
The CCBM is also available to counterparties of certain non-Eurosystem national central banks .
Cross-border settlement : a settlement which takes place in a country other than the country or countries in which one or both of the parties to the trade are located .
Currency hedge transaction : an agreement entered into between the issuer and a hedge counterparty , pursuant to which a portion of the currency risk arising from the receipt of cash flows in non-euro currency is mitigated by swapping the cash flows for euro currency payments to be made by the hedge counterparty , including any guarantee by the hedge counterparty of those payments .
Custodian : an entity which undertakes the safekeeping and administration of securities and other financial assets on behalf of others .
Day-count convention : the convention regulating the number of days included in the calculation of interest on credits . The Eurosystem applies the day-count convention actual / 360 in its monetary policy operations .
Glossary
Default event : an event referred to in the Eurosystem credit assessment framework ( ECAF ) that is covered by the definition contained in the Directive 2006/48 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2006 relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions ( recast ) and Directive 2006/49 / EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2006 on the capital adequacy of investment firms and credit institutions ( recast ) ( together referred to as the « Capital Requirements Directive » ( CRD )) . Thus , a default event occurs when « ( a ) the credit institution considers that the obligor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the credit institution , the parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries in full , without recourse by the credit institution to actions such as realising security ( if held ) , » and / or « ( b ) the obligor is past due more than 90 days on any material credit obligation to the credit institution , the parent undertaking or any of its subsidiaries ."
Delivery-versus-payment or delivery-against-payment system : a mechanism in an exchange-forvalue settlement system which ensures that the final transfer of assets ( securities or other financial instruments ) occurs if , and only if , the final transfer of another asset ( or other assets ) occurs . Dematerialisation : the elimination of physical certificates or documents of title which represent ownership of financial assets , so that the financial assets exist only as accounting records .

End-of-day : the time of the business day following closure of TARGET2 at which the payments processed in TARGET2 are finalised for the day .
ECB The implementation of monetary policy in the euro area November 2008 APPENDIX 2 Euro area : the area encompassing the EU Member States which have adopted the euro as their single currency in accordance with the Treaty and in which a single monetary policy is conducted under the responsibility of the Governing Council of the ECB .
European System of Central Banks ( ESCB ) : the European Central Bank ( ECB ) and the national central banks of the EU Member States . It should be noted that the national central banks of those Member States which have not adopted the single currency in accordance with the Treaty retain their powers in the field of monetary policy according to national law and are thus not involved in the conduct of the monetary policy of the Eurosystem .
Eurosystem : the European Central Bank ( ECB ) and the national central banks of the Member States of the euro area .
The decision-making bodies of the Eurosystem are the Governing Council and the Executive Board of the ECB .
Eurosystem business day : any day on which the ECB and at least one national central bank are open for the purpose of conducting Eurosystem monetary policy operations . Eurosystem credit assessment framework ( ECAF ) : the set of procedures , rules and techniques that ensures that the Eurosystem 's requirement of high credit standards for all eligible assets is met .
In the establishment of high credit standards , the Eurosystem differentiates between marketable and non-marketable assets . In the assessment of the credit standard of eligible assets , the Eurosystem takes into account credit assessment information from credit assessment systems belonging to one of four sources , namely external credit assessment institutions ( ECAIs ) , national central banks » in-house credit assessment systems ( ICASs ) , counterparties » internal ratings-based ( IRB ) systems or third-party providers » rating tools ( RTs ) .
In addition , in the assessment of the credit standard , the Eurosystem takes into account institutional criteria and features that guarantee similar protection for the instrument holder such as guarantees .
The Eurosystem 's benchmark for establishing its minimum requirement for high credit standards ( credit quality threshold ) is defined in terms of a « single A » credit assessment .
The Eurosystem considers a probability of default ( PD ) of 0.10% over a one-year horizon to be equivalent to a « single A » credit assessment . External credit assessment institution ( ECAI ) : a credit quality assessment source provided for in the Eurosystem credit assessment framework ( ECAF ) that comprises those institutions whose credit assessments may be used by credit institutions for the determination of risk weight exposures according to the Capital Requirements Directive .

Longer-term refinancing operations are executed through monthly standard tenders and normally have a maturity of three months .
APPENDIX 2 Lump-sum allowance : a fixed amount which an institution deducts in the calculation of its reserve requirement within the minimum reserve framework of the Eurosystem .
Main refinancing operation : a regular open market operation executed by the Eurosystem in the form of a reverse transaction .
The ECB publishes a calendar of the reserve maintenance periods at least three months before the start of each year . Maintenance periods begin on the settlement day of the first main refinancing operation following the meeting of the Governing Council at which the monthly assessment of the monetary policy stance is pre-scheduled .
They normally end on the day preceding the similar settlement day in the following month . Under special circumstances , the published calendar may be amended , depending , among other things , on changes in the schedule of Governing Council meetings .
Margin call : a procedure related to the application of variation margins , implying that if the value , as regularly measured , of the underlying assets falls below a certain level , the central bank requires counterparties to supply additional assets ( or cash ) .
Similarly , if the value of the underlying assets , following their revaluation , were to exceed the amount owed by the counterparties plus the variation margin , the counterparty may ask the central bank to return the excess assets ( or cash ) to the counterparty . Marginal interest rate : the interest rate at which the total tender allotment is exhausted .
Maturity bucket : a class of assets , the residual maturity of which is within a certain range of values , e.g. the three-to-five-year maturity bucket .

In addition , the issuance of debt certificates and outright transactions are available for structural operations , while foreign exchange swaps and the collection of fixed-term deposits are available for the conduct of fine-tuning operations . Outright transaction : a transaction whereby assets are bought or sold up to their maturity ( spot or forward ) .
Pooling system : see collateral pooling system . Post-fixed coupon : a coupon on floating rate instruments which is determined on the basis of the values taken by the reference index on a certain date ( or dates ) during the coupon accrual period .
84 ECB The implementation of monetary policy in the euro area November 2008
APPENDIX 2 Pre-fixed coupon : a coupon on floating rate instruments which is determined on the basis of the values taken by the reference index on a certain date ( or dates ) before the start of the coupon accrual period . Purchase date : the date on which the sale of purchased assets by the seller to the buyer becomes effective .

Rating tools ( RTs ) : a credit quality assessment source provided for in the Eurosystem credit assessment framework ( ECAF ) that comprises third-party applications that assess the credit quality of debtors by using , among other information , audited accounts .
Repurchase agreement : an arrangement whereby an asset is sold while the seller simultaneously obtains the right and obligation to repurchase it at a specific price on a future date or on demand .
Such an agreement is similar to collateralised borrowing , with the difference that ownership of the securities is not retained by the seller .
Reserve requirement : the requirement for institutions to hold minimum reserves with the central bank . Within the minimum reserve framework of the Eurosystem , the reserve requirement of a credit institution is calculated by multiplying the reserve ratio for each category of items in the reserve base with the amount of those items on the institution 's balance sheet .
In addition , institutions deduct a lump-sum allowance from their reserve requirement . Residual maturity : the time remaining until the maturity date of a debt instrument .
Reverse transaction : an operation whereby the national central bank buys or sells assets under a repurchase agreement or conducts credit operations against collateral . RTGS ( real-time gross settlement ) system : a settlement system in which processing and settlement take place on an order-by-order basis without netting continuously in real time .

All counterparties fulfilling the general eligibility criteria are entitled to submit bids in standard tenders .
Standardised deduction : the fixed percentage of the amount outstanding of debt securities with an agreed maturity of up to two years ( including money market paper ) which can be deducted from the reserve base by the issuers which cannot present evidence that such outstanding amount is held by other institutions subject to the minimum reserve system of the Eurosystem , by the ECB or by a national central bank .
ECB The implementation of monetary policy in the euro area November 2008 APPENDIX 2 Standing facility : a central bank facility available to counterparties at their own initiative .

Valuation haircut : a risk control measure applied to underlying assets used in reverse transactions , implying that the central bank calculates the value of underlying assets as the market value of the assets reduced by a certain percentage ( haircut ) .
The Eurosystem applies valuation haircuts reflecting features of the specific assets , such as the residual maturity . Valuation markdown : a risk control measure applied to underlying assets used in reverse transactions , meaning that the central bank applies a reduction of the theoretical market value of the assets by a certain percentage before applying any valuation haircut .
Variation margin ( marking to market ) : a certain level of the market value of the underlying assets used in the Eurosystem 's liquidity-providing reverse transactions that the Eurosystem requires to be maintained over time . This implies that if the value , measured on a regular basis , of the underlying assets falls below a certain level , the national central bank will require the counterparty to supply additional assets or cash ( i.e. a margin call ) .
Similarly , if the value of the underlying assets , following their revaluation , exceeds a certain level , the counterparty may retrieve the excess assets or cash .
Zero coupon bond : a security paying only one cash flow during its life .
For the purpose of this document , zero coupon bonds include securities issued at a discount and securities which deliver a single coupon at maturity .
Thus , for example , for asset-backed securities in liquidity category V that are valued using a theoretical price , a valuation markdown of 5 % is applied to the theoretical price before the application of the valuation haircut of 12 %.

APPENDIX 3 SELECTION OF COUNTERPARTIES FOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE INTERVENTION OPERATIONS AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE SWAPS FOR MONETARY POLICY PURPOSES The selection of counterparties for foreign exchange intervention operations and foreign exchange swaps for monetary policy purposes follows a uniform approach irrespective of the chosen organisational set-up for the Eurosystem 's external operations .
In order to be able to intervene efficiently in different geographical locations and time zones , the Eurosystem can use counterparties in any international financial centre . However , in ECB The implementation of monetary policy in the euro area November 2008
APPENDIX 3 Selection of counterparties for foreign exchange intervention operations and foreign exchange swaps for monetary policy purposes practice , a substantial share of the counterparties tend to be located in the euro area .
For foreign exchange swaps executed for monetary policy purposes , the range of counterparties corresponds to the counterparties located in the euro area which are selected for Eurosystem foreign exchange intervention operations .
The national central banks may apply limitbased systems in order to control credit exposures vis-à-vis individual counterparties in foreign exchange swaps conducted for monetary policy purposes .
APPENDIX 4 REPORTING FRAMEWORK FOR THE MONEY AND BANKING STATISTICS OF THE EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK 1 1 INTRODUCTION Council Regulation ( EC ) No 2533/98 of 23 November 1998 concerning the collection of statistical information by the European Central Bank 2 defines the natural and legal persons which are subject to reporting requirements ( the so-called reference reporting population ) , the confidentiality regime and the appropriate provisions for enforcement in accordance with Article 5.4 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank ( Statute of the ESCB ) .
Furthermore , it entitles the ECB to use its regulatory power : -* to specify the actual reporting population ;
-* to define the ECB 's statistical reporting requirements and impose them on the actual reporting population of participating Member States ; and -* to specify the conditions under which the ECB and the national central banks ( NCBs ) may exercise the right to verify or to carry out the compulsory collection of statistical information .
consolidated balance sheet of the monetary financial institutions ( MFI ) sector , the principal aim of which is to provide the ECB with a comprehensive statistical picture of monetary developments covering the aggregated financial assets and liabilities of MFIs in the participating Member States , which are viewed as one economic territory .
Although the data are collected in a decentralised way by national central banks in accordance with Articles 5.1 and 5.2 of the Statute and , as far as necessary , in combination with further statistical requirements for Community or national purposes , a sufficient degree of harmonisation and compliance with minimum reporting standards is required in view of the need to establish a reliable statistical basis for the definition and conduct of the single monetary policy .
It imposes obligations directly on natural and legal persons on which the ECB may impose sanctions whenever the ECB 's reporting requirements are not fulfilled ( see Article 7 of Council Regulation ( EC ) No 2533/98 .
The reporting obligations are therefore clearly defined and any discretion exercised by the ECB when verifying or
GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS
The purpose of Regulation ( EC ) No 2423/2001 of the European Central Bank of 22 November 2001 concerning the consolidated balance sheet of the monetary financial institutions sector ( ECB / 2001/13 ) , as amended , 3 is to enable the ECB and , in accordance with Article 5.2 of the Statute , the national central banks -- which carry out the work to the extent possible -- to collect the statistical material required for the fulfilment of the tasks of the European System of Central Banks ( ESCB ) and , in particular , its task to define and implement the monetary policy of the Community in accordance with Article 105 ( 2 ) , first indent , of the Treaty establishing the European Community ( Treaty ) . The statistical information collected in accordance with Regulation ECB / 2001/13 is used to establish the
1 The content of this appendix is provided for information purposes only . 2 OJ L 318 , 27.11.1998 , p. 8 .
This Regulation has replaced Regulation ( EC ) No. 2819/98 of the European Central Bank of 1 December 1998 ( ECB / 1998/16 ) .
ECB The implementation of monetary policy in the euro area November 2008 APPENDIX 4 compulsorily collecting statistical information follows identifiable principles .
Third , the ECB must minimise the reporting burden involved ( see Article 3 ( a ) of Council Regulation ( EC ) No 2533/98 ) .
Therefore , the statistical material collected by national central banks under Regulation ECB / 2001/13 is also used to calculate the reserve base in accordance with Regulation ( EC ) No 1745/2003 of the European Central Bank of 12 September 2003 on the application of minimum reserves ( ECB / 2003/9 ) 4 .
The articles of Regulation ECB / 2001/13 , as amended , restrict themselves to defining , in general terms , the actual reporting population , its reporting obligations and the principles according to which the ECB and the national central banks normally exercise their competence to verify or compulsorily collect statistical information .
The details of the statistical information to be reported in order to fulfil the ECB 's statistical reporting requirements and the minimum standards to be followed are specified in Annexes I to IV to Regulation ECB / 2001/13 .
sheet account for at least 95 % of the total MFI balance sheet in each participating Member State . These derogations enable national central banks to apply the method of « cutting off the tail » .
Reporting framework for the money and banking statistics of the European Central Bank
STATISTICAL REPORTING OBLIGATIONS
To establish the consolidated balance sheet , the actual resident reporting population must report statistical information related to their balance sheet on a monthly basis .
The relevant statistical data are collected by the national central banks , which must define the reporting procedures to be followed .
Regulation ECB / 2001/13 , as amended , does not prevent national central banks from collecting , from the actual reporting population , the statistical information necessary to fulfil the statistical requirements of the ECB as part of a broader statistical reporting framework which the national central banks establish under their own responsibility in accordance with Community or national law or established practice and which serves other statistical purposes . However , this should be without prejudice to the fulfilment of the statistical requirements set out in Regulation ECB / 2001/13 .
However , MFIs which have been granted a derogation have the option of fulfilling the full reporting requirements . 4 OJ L 250 , 2.10.2003 , p. 10 .
ACTUAL REPORTING POPULATION ; LIST OF MFIs FOR STATISTICAL PURPOSES
MFIs comprise resident credit institutions , as defined in Community law , and all other resident financial institutions whose business is to receive deposits and / or close substitutes for deposits from entities other than MFIs and , for their own account ( at least in economic terms ) , to grant credit and / or invest in securities .
The ECB establishes and maintains a list of institutions in accordance with this definition and following the classification principles specified in Annex I to Regulation ECB / 2001/13 .
National central banks are entitled to grant derogations to small MFIs if the MFIs which contribute to the monthly consolidated balance ECB The implementation of monetary policy in the euro area November 2008
5 USE OF STATISTICAL INFORMATION UNDER THE ECB REGULATION ON MINIMUM RESERVES
To minimise the reporting burden and to avoid any duplication in the collection of statistical information , the statistical information related to the balance sheet reported by MFIs under Regulation ECB / 2001/13 is also used to calculate the reserve base under Regulation ECB / 2003/9 .
Indeed , for statistical purposes , the reporting agents have to report data to their respective national central bank in accordance with the framework of Table 1 below , which is included in Annex I to Regulation ECB / 2001/13 .
In Table 1 , the boxes marked with an « * » are used by the reporting institutions to calculate their reserve base ( see Box 9 in Chapter 7 of this publication ) .
In order to make a correct calculation of the reserve base to which a positive reserve ratio is applied , a detailed breakdown is required for deposits with an agreed maturity of over two years , for deposits redeemable at notice of over two years and for repo liabilities of credit institutions vis-à-vis the (" domestic » and « other participating Member States ") « MFIs » , « credit institutions subject to reserve requirements , ECB and NCBs » and « Central government » sectors , and vis-à-vis the « Rest of the world » ( RoW ) .
The tail institutions » reserve base data for three reserve maintenance periods are based on end-ofquarter data collected by the national central banks .
On receiving authorisation from the ECB , credit institutions subject to minimum reserves may carry out consolidated statistical reporting for a group of credit institutions subject to minimum reserves within a single national territory , provided that all the institutions concerned have renounced the benefit of any lump-sum allowance from the reserve requirement .
The benefit of the lumpsum allowance remains , however , for the group as a whole .
All the institutions concerned are included separately in the ECB 's List of MFIs .
For consecutive reserve maintenance periods , the reserve requirements of the acquiring institution are calculated on the basis of a reserve base and of statistical information in accordance with specific rules ( see the table in the Annex to Annex II to Regulation ECB / 2001/13 ) , if applicable .
Moreover , the relevant national central bank may authorise the acquiring institution to fulfil its obligation to report statistical information 92
APPENDIX 4 through temporary procedures . This derogation from normal reporting procedures must be limited to the minimum time possible and , in any case , should not exceed six months after the merger has taken effect .
This derogation is without prejudice to the obligation for the acquiring institution to fulfil its reporting obligations in accordance with Regulation ECB / 2001/13 and , if applicable , its obligation to assume the reporting obligations of merging institutions . The acquiring institution has the obligation to inform the relevant national central bank , once the intention to merge has become public and in good time before the merger takes effect , of the procedures that it intends to implement to fulfil its statistical reporting obligations relating to the determination of reserve requirements .
Regulation ( EC ) No 2533/98 are applicable in all Member States . This also implies , together with Article 10 ( ex Article 5 ) of the Treaty , an obligation on the non-participating Member States to design and implement at the national level all the measures that they consider appropriate in order to carry out the collection of statistical information needed to fulfil the ECB 's statistical reporting requirements and the timely preparations in the field of statistics in order for them to become participating Member States .
The ECB itself and the national central banks normally exercise the competence to verify and compulsorily collect statistical information whenever minimum standards for transmission , accuracy , conceptual compliance and revisions are not fulfilled . These minimum standards are set out in Annex IV to Regulation ECB / 2001/13 .
NON-PARTICIPATING MEMBER STATES
As a regulation under Article 34.1 of the Statute of the ESCB does not confer any rights or impose any obligations on Member States with a derogation ( Article 43.1 of the Statute of the ESCB ) and on Denmark ( Article 2 of the Protocol on certain provisions relating to Denmark ) and is not applicable to the United Kingdom ( Article 8 of the Protocol on certain provisions relating to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland ) , Regulation ECB / 2001/13 is applicable only in the participating Member States .
